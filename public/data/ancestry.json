flexibility of a yew branch, flowers and fruit sprinkled across a forest canopy like jewels in a crown, soft moss blankets, and the daytime constellations created by pinpricks of light through leaves—this is what ardandes are made of. ardandes are geniekin, or elemental planar scions, born with elemental wood for flesh and blood-like sap flowing through their veins; just as much elemental essence as they are mortal. they are the descendants of wood elementals, kizidhars, dryads, and forest dragons, or were born under the influence of powerful elemental forces tied to the first world or plane of wood. ardandes often share a connection to specific aspects of wood, such as spring blossoms, ancient and rotten stumps seething with life that feeds on their decay, or sap dripping down tree bark; this is called an ardande lineage. typically, an ardande has the same lineage as their ardande parent, though some are born with a new or different lineage, or to parents who didn't have one. sometimes a lineage reflects where an ardande was born, such as springsoul ardandes born in the vibrant, portal-riddled grungir forest in the lands of the linnorm kings, or moldersoul ardandes influenced by the darkblight infection of the southern fangwood. they can also occur as a reflection of the ardande's planar ancestry, like ambersoul ardandes who descend from kizidhars. if you want to play a character who embodies the tenacity, flexibility, and succor of elemental wood, you should play an ardande. you might... associate your personal identity with elemental wood, and believe the characteristics of wood, plants, and trees form core aspects of your personality. enjoy giving gifts or expressing love for your friends with food and hospitality. take pride in your elemental lineage and your connection to the previously lost plane of wood. others probably... look to you as an authority on plant creatures and the plane of wood. take you for granted as an endless well of energy, patience, and support. mistake you for a ghoran or dryad, perhaps not even realizing there is an elemental plane of wood. physical description ardandes vary in appearance just as much as their different ancestors do. green, brown, and ash gray are the most common skin tones, though many also have bodies covered in moss, bark, or knotted wood. ardandes are often born with coils of ivy or flowering vines for hair, but just as common are those who grow beards made of petals or leaves, or hair that rustles like a leaf caught in a perpetual wind. most smell like dew on fresh grass, wildflowers, or a mossy forest floor. rarely, an ardande is born with amber or bark for nails, leaves or delicate petals freckling their skin, or even rotten, mossy bodies that shed spores and resin. society poorly understood by both themselves and others, ardandes born before the plane of wood's return have struggled to fully comprehend their own heritage. due to the plane of wood's longstanding absence from the universe, golarion has had too few ardandes for the wood geniekin to form their own societies or cultural norms. in most regions where ardandes are found, only a single family might have a connection to elemental wood, and the norms of the elemental scions of wood in those areas are simply those of that single ardande family. alignment and religion many ardandes value community and family. religious ardandes gravitate to the faiths of wood and nature deities, such as gozreh, the green mother, shyka, or the elemental lords of wood, shumunue and verilorn. some venerate the kings of the leshies, known as the green men, or join druidic orders or other spiritual practices focused on nature, like the green faith. evil ardandes sometimes look to gods who represent destruction, disease, and rot for guidance, like urgathoa, groetus, or the demon lord treerazer. the ardandes who venerate these vile gods often interpret corruption and disease as necessary components of nature's eternal cycle: death that carves the way for renewal, rather than death as a final ending. popular edicts flow with the cycles of nature, grow the world i want to live in popular anathema betray my family adventurers misunderstood and unexplained, many ardande children turn to lives of adventure as they search for answers and information about themselves. backgrounds as artists and artisans are common, as woodcrafts and sculpture often help them to feel connected with kizidhar ancestors, though many also become scholars and elementalists in their quests to uncover the secrets of the inner sphere and their place inside it. other information ardande settlements in most parts of golarion, ardande bloodlines are only just beginning to return. two families of ardandes in tian xia (both descended from the same forest dragon) managed to retain their connection to elemental wood, while across the world in distant arcadia, ardande families have kept their elemental heritage intact through continued dealings with the fey . ardande relations forest dragons and dryad are common ancestors for ardandes born before the return of the plane of wood, or kizidhars who became trapped in the universe and were forced to make new lives for themselves. ardandes with wood scamp parents are often short and bushy, like living shrubs, and are often mistaken for leshies and conrasus. ardande heritage mechanics you descend from wood elementals or have some other heritage influenced by the elemental plane of wood. you might have green, mossy skin, vines that grow from your head instead of hair, or thin appendages that resemble twigs. you gain the ardande trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. you also gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. you can choose from ardande feats, geniekin feats, and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry

Their brightly colored skin often matches the reefs where they build their communities. Frills, barbels, and crested fins add to their flamboyant appearance. The sheer variety of crest shapes, scale patterns, and fin styles make individuals distinct, even as communities share features. These similarities are often environmentally advantageous, such as scales that allow them to blend into seaweed or longer toes in areas with stony seabeds. Outsiders often note that athamarus have a distinctive smell, which comes from pheromones, used for both communication and defense. While the level of control varies, all athamarus can communicate basic emotions chemically, and individual settlements have unique variations to their pheromones that serve as a community fingerprint. Masters of pheromonal expression can communicate complex philosophical concepts purely chemically, occupying a role similar to master singers in other communities.\n\n Athamarus value natural adornments that blur the lines between body modifications and jewelry. In areas where coral grows, tending reefs and their symbiotic species are highly valued tasks. Some fashion still-living specimens into earrings or cuffs, then gently guide the coral as it continues to grow. These pieces often stay in circulation for generations and are valued as living community history. Other uses of coral include integrating pieces in with the wearer's body in symbiosis, the coral providing nutrients and the athamaru ensuring access to sunlight and quality water.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nThe largest population of athamarus lives in the underwater nation of Xidao in Tian Xia. There, smaller city-states follow their own government and leaders, though they have vowed to protect one another from the terrors of the deep should the need arise. The largest city-state, Yashabaru, has no direct control over the other settlements, but its leader serves as a figurehead for the region. Outside of Xidao, communities are more isolated and independent, though population centers include the Shackles, a reclusive settlement near Sedeq, and the large gulfs of Arcadia.\n\n The smallest individual athamaru settlements might have only a dozen members, while the largest house hundreds. Athamaru communities connect with other aquatic inhabitants to build strong bonds that improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Animals are integrated into their communities as partners, particularly the domesticated eels that athamarus use as steeds. The eels generally roam freely, and athamarus train mounts from newly hatched elvers they raise.\n\n Each community consists of genetically related athamarus, typically all born from a single parent. In most settlements, the parent is known as the matriarch and serves as the leader. When this parent nears the end of their life or otherwise stops laying eggs, several athamarus in the community choose to undergo certain physical changes, including an increase in size, to announce their intention to become the next matriarch. The decision to be considered a matriarch isn't taken lightly, as the eventual leadership role is responsible for the community's survival and continuation. Each community selects their next matriarch from these “hopefuls” in their own way. Such traditions include democratic elections, trials of knowledge, and contests of physicality involving deep diving or riding untamed wildlife. In Xidao, citystate matriarch candidates must present themselves to the High Matriarch and their council to be judged worthy of completing the transformation.\n\n Sometimes young adults split off to create new communities, especially if resources become scarce or internal conflict escalates. If a group struggles as they establish a community, their former settlement often agrees to take them back if they agree to respect the extant leadership.\n\n Other groups have mistreated athamarus in the past, so their communities maintain strong internal bonds. Athamarus consider it less risky to deal with each other first. While the most common activities between them are trade, communities also share information. Warnings about danger flow quickly. Safe opportunities are also shared, such as trustworthy land-dwellers and open markets. Such trust with outsiders, however, is easily lost and hard to regain. Most athamarus would rather flee—sometimes even uprooting an entire community—than risk open hostilities.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nDue to their community-minded nature, athamarus tend to favor beliefs and philosophies that focus on connection and aiding others. They are also aware that they sometimes require protection from the dangers of the sea, so some athamarus take on the roles of staunch guardians or religious figures who plead for intercession from sympathetic gods. Worship within a single community tends to favor one deity, with multiple temples being rare. In the Inner Sea, athamaru settlements typically revere the nature god [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284) to strengthen their bonds with their surroundings or [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=282) for guidance on forming healthy communities. In Tian Xia, the Duke of Thunder [Hei Feng's](/Deities.aspx?ID=307) favor is sought as athamarus navigate fickle seasons and politics, while those athamarus who guard the seas against horrors from the deep pray to the triad war gods Srikalis, Sritaming, and Sribaril for unwavering strength.\n\n **Popular Edicts** seek out new experiences away from your place of birth, lead your community to a better future <br />**Popular Anathema** betray your community or otherwise knowingly do it harm\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nAthamarus are strongly motivated by community, and most who choose to leave their community to adventure have a good reason why. Many begin adventuring to protect their community or solve a particular problem, while others are thrust out into the wider world after a tragedy. The [animal whisperer](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=408), [emissary](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=420), and [sailor](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=439) backgrounds complement athamarus well.

The first syllable is shared by all members of a generation, and the last two syllables identify an individual.

tight-knit communities underseas, with villages of siblings led by a common matriarch. athamarus engage in subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. athamarus are fish-like humanoids who form tight-knit undersea communities. in small settlements, they engage in the subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. their interactions with other aquatic ancestries are strained, as athamarus have suffered mistreatment at their hands. however, they remain curious about potential connections and what new opportunities may offer. athamarus define themselves by their connections to the world around them. they live in communal settings among coral reefs and aquatic companion creatures that encourage large families and friend groups. athamaru settlements established near river or sea trade routes usually maintain strong relationships with the sailors who regularly pass by, exchanging coral jewelry or information about nearby sea routes for surface goods, especially root foods like tubers, yams, and other vegetables, which they see as delicacies. if you want to play a character who values community and survives the sea through effort alone, you should play an athamaru. you might... value your community above most everything else. approach strangers with warm curiosity. others probably... assume you're well versed in underwater survival. believe you're to blame for foul smells. physical description athamarus have a distinctive appearance that resembles fish. their brightly colored skin often matches the reefs where they build their communities. frills, barbels, and crested fins add to their flamboyant appearance. the sheer variety of crest shapes, scale patterns, and fin styles make individuals distinct, even as communities share features. these similarities are often environmentally advantageous, such as scales that allow them to blend into seaweed or longer toes in areas with stony seabeds. outsiders often note that athamarus have a distinctive smell, which comes from pheromones, used for both communication and defense. while the level of control varies, all athamarus can communicate basic emotions chemically, and individual settlements have unique variations to their pheromones that serve as a community fingerprint. masters of pheromonal expression can communicate complex philosophical concepts purely chemically, occupying a role similar to master singers in other communities. athamarus value natural adornments that blur the lines between body modifications and jewelry. in areas where coral grows, tending reefs and their symbiotic species are highly valued tasks. some fashion still-living specimens into earrings or cuffs, then gently guide the coral as it continues to grow. these pieces often stay in circulation for generations and are valued as living community history. other uses of coral include integrating pieces in with the wearer's body in symbiosis, the coral providing nutrients and the athamaru ensuring access to sunlight and quality water. society the largest population of athamarus lives in the underwater nation of xidao in tian xia. there, smaller city-states follow their own government and leaders, though they have vowed to protect one another from the terrors of the deep should the need arise. the largest city-state, yashabaru, has no direct control over the other settlements, but its leader serves as a figurehead for the region. outside of xidao, communities are more isolated and independent, though population centers include the shackles, a reclusive settlement near sedeq, and the large gulfs of arcadia. the smallest individual athamaru settlements might have only a dozen members, while the largest house hundreds. athamaru communities connect with other aquatic inhabitants to build strong bonds that improve the quality of life for everyone involved. animals are integrated into their communities as partners, particularly the domesticated eels that athamarus use as steeds. the eels generally roam freely, and athamarus train mounts from newly hatched elvers they raise. each community consists of genetically related athamarus, typically all born from a single parent. in most settlements, the parent is known as the matriarch and serves as the leader. when this parent nears the end of their life or otherwise stops laying eggs, several athamarus in the community choose to undergo certain physical changes, including an increase in size, to announce their intention to become the next matriarch. the decision to be considered a matriarch isn't taken lightly, as the eventual leadership role is responsible for the community's survival and continuation. each community selects their next matriarch from these “hopefuls” in their own way. such traditions include democratic elections, trials of knowledge, and contests of physicality involving deep diving or riding untamed wildlife. in xidao, citystate matriarch candidates must present themselves to the high matriarch and their council to be judged worthy of completing the transformation. sometimes young adults split off to create new communities, especially if resources become scarce or internal conflict escalates. if a group struggles as they establish a community, their former settlement often agrees to take them back if they agree to respect the extant leadership. other groups have mistreated athamarus in the past, so their communities maintain strong internal bonds. athamarus consider it less risky to deal with each other first. while the most common activities between them are trade, communities also share information. warnings about danger flow quickly. safe opportunities are also shared, such as trustworthy land-dwellers and open markets. such trust with outsiders, however, is easily lost and hard to regain. most athamarus would rather flee—sometimes even uprooting an entire community—than risk open hostilities. alignment and religion due to their community-minded nature, athamarus tend to favor beliefs and philosophies that focus on connection and aiding others. they are also aware that they sometimes require protection from the dangers of the sea, so some athamarus take on the roles of staunch guardians or religious figures who plead for intercession from sympathetic gods. worship within a single community tends to favor one deity, with multiple temples being rare. in the inner sea, athamaru settlements typically revere the nature god gozreh to strengthen their bonds with their surroundings or erastil for guidance on forming healthy communities. in tian xia, the duke of thunder hei feng's favor is sought as athamarus navigate fickle seasons and politics, while those athamarus who guard the seas against horrors from the deep pray to the triad war gods srikalis, sritaming, and sribaril for unwavering strength. popular edicts seek out new experiences away from your place of birth, lead your community to a better future popular anathema betray your community or otherwise knowingly do it harm adventurers athamarus are strongly motivated by community, and most who choose to leave their community to adventure have a good reason why. many begin adventuring to protect their community or solve a particular problem, while others are thrust out into the wider world after a tragedy. the animal whisperer, emissary, and sailor backgrounds complement athamarus well. eel-mounted champions or rangers often serve as athamaru community protectors, and those who want to connect with others train as bards. though athamaru spellcasters are typically rare, some use their strong relationship to the natural world to become druids. names athamaru names typically consist of three syllables. the first syllable is shared by all members of a generation, and the last two syllables identify an individual. when traveling outside their communities, they introduce themselves by their community name first. some communities, particularly those in xidao, break this convention, but those names still maintain a flow and identify athamarus hatched in the same year. sample names aussandor, cayiel, corlena, mithae, onteac, paquotal other information athamaru metamorphosis any adult athamaru can undergo a metamorphosis to become larger. this typically happens when they intend to become a matriarch. the process doesn’t innately change an athamaru’s understanding of their gender, but is viewed rather as a new stage in their life. athamarus can metamorphose without their community needing a new matriarch. this most commonly occurs when they intend to leave and form a new community. when a matriarch abdicates, they often slowly transition back from their larger form, though they will always be taller than the average athamaru and typically command some additional respect even after their role as matriarch is a thing of the past. athamaru mechanics hit points 8 size medium speed attribute boosts strength, wisdom, free attribute flaws intelligence languages common thalassic additional languages equal to your

[Howl of the Wild](/Sources.aspx?ID=226) pg. 22 <sup>2.1</sup>\n\n_Awakened animals were once normal creatures before they obtained sapience that gave them one paw in nature and the other in the world of cities and society. Almost any animal can be awakened, allowing for a wide variety of characters._\r\n\r\nYou once enjoyed the simple and boundless pleasures of nature with an innocent, uncluttered mind. You lived from moment to moment, never questioning what comes next or pondering the ramifications of what happened before. You were at one with the wild. Then came the event that changed everything. You drank from a glowing lake, someone pulled a magical prank, a druid sought to elevate your mind. You were pulled out of the present moment of the wild and into a land of thought.\n\n For the first time, you realized you had a past. For the first time, you started to think about your future. Now you experience the world in a whole new way. You become aware of dangers that never occurred to you before, but there are pleasures and wonders aplenty in this new world, too. That's a good thing, because there's no going back to how things were.\n\n Awakened animals were normal animals that underwent an experience that awakened their minds, giving them full intelligence and the ability to perceive the world through a lens of thought. There are many mysterious ways for animals to awaken, but the most well-known path is through the ritual [_awaken animal_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=109).\n\n Every animal takes the process of awakening differently. For some, the opening of their mind is electric, allowing them to perceive and ponder the world like never before. Others are overwhelmed by emotions and thoughts that they didn't ask for and weren't ready to hold. Most people who would awaken an animal assume that the animal they awaken will be full of wonder and gratitude and aren't prepared for the wide variety of responses they receive: shock, sadness, euphoria, curiosity, and anger are common (but not the only ones).\n\n No matter how an awakened animal reacts, they still must find their way in the world. Some awakened animals try to go back to their lives but almost always find themselves disconnected from their unawakened peers. Others embrace the civilized world entirely, doing their best to navigate a world built for humanoids. Over time, awakened animals find themselves moving between both the civilized world and the wild, for each holds only a part of what they need from life.\n\n If you want to play a character who is extremely outside the norm and crosses between the civilized and natural worlds, you should play an awakened animal.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Awakened_Animal01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Awakened_Animal02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Negotiate between humanoid societies and creatures of the wilderness.</li><li>Oscillate between rumination and acting with wild aggression.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Think you are a beast who is easily provoked.</li><li>Want to study you as an oddity without respect for your agency or comfort.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nAwakened animals are very similar in appearance to the animals they once were. From a glance, it is difficult for humanoids to tell an awakened animal apart from others of its species. On closer inspection, most humanoids notice something different about the eyes and movements of an awakened animal. The awakened animal carries themself in a way that is self-aware, and even those who don't know that the animal is awakened feel that difference. Often awakened animals take on the practice of wearing clothing and other adornments, and using tools, which truly make their awakened nature obvious.\n\n Animals recognize awakened animals instantly and react with trepidation at first. If welcomed, eventually the animal will settle and approach the awakened animal. It takes a long time for an animal to be truly comfortable around its awakened brethren, but over time it can happen.\n\n Traumatic awakenings sometimes create stunning visual differences in an awakened animal. There are tales of awakened bears with flame-red fur and birds with ghostly feathers.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nAwakened animals are rare enough and separate enough that few find themselves traveling together, let alone making their own societies. Awakened animals often settle into the societies that are close by, integrating in disguise as a “typical” animal or overtly as craftspeople and laborers. While an awakened animal may decide that humanoid society is not for them, those that stay do not find much trouble in adapting. Most places in Golarion have seen enough that people get over their initial shock at seeing a talking house cat or songbird quickly.\n\n Awakened animals who have turned their back on “civilized” life tend to create animal societies that they are the natural rulers and leaders of. They use their intelligence to create order and structure that animals of their type wouldn't otherwise be able to do. There are tales in Ustalav of large wolf packs made of several combined packs led by an awakened wolf. The pack roams the countryside, protecting villages from incursions of undead. In Isger, merchants tell tales of bears who attack caravans, but do only enough damage to steal the goods before leaving.\n\n There are also rumors of a city full of awakened animals in Iobaria named Roam. Most awakened animals hear about it at some point in their lives. Some think of it as a fanciful dream, but many do attempt to find it. Roam is said to be the true home of all awakened animals, a place where their intellect and wild spirits are equally welcome.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nAwakened animals tend to see the world through a lens of natural order. Those who are unsettled by humans or have been traumatized by them typically live within nature, while those driven by curiosity or structure seek to find a place in the more ordered and rule-bound nature of humanoid society.\n\n There is no uniform religion among awakened animals, but it is unsurprising that gods with domains in the natural world, like [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284), are popular. There are small groups of awakened animals who worship destructive gods such as [Lamashtu](/Deities.aspx?ID=287) and [Rovagug](/Deities.aspx?ID=291). Those who were awakened by a companion might adopt that companion's outlook, and possibly adopt that companion's religion as well.\n\n **Popular Edicts** explore your newfound sentience, enjoy the creature comforts of humanoid civilization; often other edicts related to your animal side, such as “keep the pack together” for a canine or “always wash your food” for a raccoon<br /> **Popular Anathema** revert to purely animalistic behaviors\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nAnimals use their senses to identify others instead of names, so their relationship with naming tends to reflect that. They might give friends nicknames that correspond to vivid feelings and sensory information. They often do this for themselves as well, only straying from these conventions if they are using a name they were given as a pet or companion or if they are trying to follow the conventions of the society around them. Sometimes they blend their instinctual approach with a more conventional name to create something bombastic and proud.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Sample Names</title>\r\nRedfur, Snarling Eye, King Halfhorn, Blacknose, Jewelmouth, Queen Scale, Yellowbeak, Bigclaw, Grinning Maw, Scowl\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Other Information</title>\r\n<title level=\"3\">Choosing an Animal</title> The best forms to choose for the awakened animal ancestry have limbs of some sort that can be modified. Even fins can be modified in awakened form. Limbless creatures like snakes might need extra accommodations to work. When talking with your GM about playing an awakened animal, talk about the specific type of animal so you can determine what’s a reasonable choice for the tone of the game.\n\nMany animals have giant-sized versions of themselves in the game, and you can take advantage of that fact to make an animal of any size that you prefer—you can have awakened giant dogs or awakened giant bees if you want! While obvious choices are avians, mammals, and reptiles, the ancestry is built to be versatile enough to represent many kinds of insects and aquatic animals as well.\n\nWhen deciding what heritages and feats to take that represent your animal, start with their primary movement ability, choose the heritage that matches it most closely, and build from there. Ancestry feats offer many ways to refine your awakened animal concept, so the heritage doesn’t need to provide everything!\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Surprising for a Moment</title> While in the real world a talking bear in armor is a sustained spectacle, in Golarion people are exposed to the fantastical regularly. When GMing for an awakened animal, it’s fine to let people be surprised by encountering an awakened animal—they’re rare! But allow your NPCs to adjust rapidly so it doesn’t become a burden or tax for the player of the awakened animal.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Animal Attacks</title> Your heritage gives you a special [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) attack instead of the [fist](/Weapons.aspx?ID=356) unarmed attack humanoids typically gain. This attack is in the [brawling](/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=4) weapon group. Work with your GM to determine which one you have, using the type of animal you are and suggestions in your heritage for guidance. For example, you might choose a beak, talon, or wing for an eagle, a fist or tail for a monkey, or a tongue or jaws for a toad.\n\n##  \n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table>\n<tr><th>Unarmed Attack</th><th>Damage</th><th>Traits</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Antler</td><td>1d6 P</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Beak</td><td>1d6 P</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Claw</td><td>1d4 S</td><td>[Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fangs</td><td>1d6 P</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Fist</td><td>1d4 B</td><td>[Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [nonlethal](/Traits.aspx?ID=661), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Horn</td><td>1d6 P</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Jaws</td><td>1d6 P</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tail</td><td>1d6 B</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [trip](/Traits.aspx?ID=716), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Talon</td><td>1d4 P</td><td>[Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Tongue</td><td>1d6 B</td><td>[Finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Wing</td><td>1d4 B</td><td>[Agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719)</td></tr>\n</table>\n</row>\n<title level=\"2\">Awakened Animal Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nTiny or Small or Medium or Large\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nConstitution, Wisdom, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nIntelligence\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

For example, you might choose a beak, talon, or wing for an eagle, a fist or tail for a monkey, or a tongue or jaws for a toad. ## Unarmed Attack Damage Traits Antler 1d6 P Finesse, unarmed Beak 1d6 P Finesse, unarmed Claw 1d4 S Agile, finesse, unarmed Fangs 1d6 P Finesse, unarmed Fist 1d4 B Agile, finesse, nonlethal, unarmed Horn 1d6 P Finesse, unarmed Jaws 1d6 P Finesse, unarmed Tail 1d6 B Finesse, trip, unarmed Talon 1d4 P Agile, finesse, unarmed Tongue 1d6 B Finesse, unarmed Wing 1d4 B Agile, finesse, unarmed Awakened Animal Mechanics Hit Points Size Tiny or Small or Medium or Large Speed Attribute Boosts Constitution, Wisdom, Free Attribute Flaws Intelligence Languages Common Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

animal. you might... negotiate between humanoid societies and creatures of the wilderness. oscillate between rumination and acting with wild aggression. others probably... think you are a beast who is easily provoked. want to study you as an oddity without respect for your agency or comfort. physical description awakened animals are very similar in appearance to the animals they once were. from a glance, it is difficult for humanoids to tell an awakened animal apart from others of its species. on closer inspection, most humanoids notice something different about the eyes and movements of an awakened animal. the awakened animal carries themself in a way that is self-aware, and even those who don't know that the animal is awakened feel that difference. often awakened animals take on the practice of wearing clothing and other adornments, and using tools, which truly make their awakened nature obvious. animals recognize awakened animals instantly and react with trepidation at first. if welcomed, eventually the animal will settle and approach the awakened animal. it takes a long time for an animal to be truly comfortable around its awakened brethren, but over time it can happen. traumatic awakenings sometimes create stunning visual differences in an awakened animal. there are tales of awakened bears with flame-red fur and birds with ghostly feathers. society awakened animals are rare enough and separate enough that few find themselves traveling together, let alone making their own societies. awakened animals often settle into the societies that are close by, integrating in disguise as a “typical” animal or overtly as craftspeople and laborers. while an awakened animal may decide that humanoid society is not for them, those that stay do not find much trouble in adapting. most places in golarion have seen enough that people get over their initial shock at seeing a talking house cat or songbird quickly. awakened animals who have turned their back on “civilized” life tend to create animal societies that they are the natural rulers and leaders of. they use their intelligence to create order and structure that animals of their type wouldn't otherwise be able to do. there are tales in ustalav of large wolf packs made of several combined packs led by an awakened wolf. the pack roams the countryside, protecting villages from incursions of undead. in isger, merchants tell tales of bears who attack caravans, but do only enough damage to steal the goods before leaving. there are also rumors of a city full of awakened animals in iobaria named roam. most awakened animals hear about it at some point in their lives. some think of it as a fanciful dream, but many do attempt to find it. roam is said to be the true home of all awakened animals, a place where their intellect and wild spirits are equally welcome. alignment and religion awakened animals tend to see the world through a lens of natural order. those who are unsettled by humans or have been traumatized by them typically live within nature, while those driven by curiosity or structure seek to find a place in the more ordered and rule-bound nature of humanoid society. there is no uniform religion among awakened animals, but it is unsurprising that gods with domains in the natural world, like gozreh, are popular. there are small groups of awakened animals who worship destructive gods such as lamashtu and rovagug. those who were awakened by a companion might adopt that companion's outlook, and possibly adopt that companion's religion as well. popular edicts explore your newfound sentience, enjoy the creature comforts of humanoid civilization; often other edicts related to your animal side, such as “keep the pack together” for a canine or “always wash your food” for a raccoon popular anathema revert to purely animalistic behaviors names animals use their senses to identify others instead of names, so their relationship with naming tends to reflect that. they might give friends nicknames that correspond to vivid feelings and sensory information. they often do this for themselves as well, only straying from these conventions if they are using a name they were given as a pet or companion or if they are trying to follow the conventions of the society around them. sometimes they blend their instinctual approach with a more conventional name to create something bombastic and proud. sample names redfur, snarling eye, king halfhorn, blacknose, jewelmouth, queen scale, yellowbeak, bigclaw, grinning maw, scowl other information choosing an animal the best forms to choose for the awakened animal ancestry have limbs of some sort that can be modified. even fins can be modified in awakened form. limbless creatures like snakes might need extra accommodations to work. when talking with your gm about playing an awakened animal, talk about the specific type of animal so you can determine what’s a reasonable choice for the tone of the game. many animals have giant-sized versions of themselves in the game, and you can take advantage of that fact to make an animal of any size that you prefer—you can have awakened giant dogs or awakened giant bees if you want! while obvious choices are avians, mammals, and reptiles, the ancestry is built to be versatile enough to represent many kinds of insects and aquatic animals as well. when deciding what heritages and feats to take that represent your animal, start with their primary movement ability, choose the heritage that matches it most closely, and build from there. ancestry feats offer many ways to refine your awakened animal concept, so the heritage doesn’t need to provide everything! surprising for a moment while in the real world a talking bear in armor is a sustained spectacle, in golarion people are exposed to the fantastical regularly. when gming for an awakened animal, it’s fine to let people be surprised by encountering an awakened animal—they’re rare! but allow your npcs to adjust rapidly so it doesn’t become a burden or tax for the player of the awakened animal. animal attacks your heritage gives you a special unarmed attack instead of the fist

nomads who range wild and free across their ancestral lands. They're survivalists with a long history of teaching and instruction who stand firm in the face of danger using their skill at archery, herbalism, and magic._\r\n\r\nCentaurs are proud nomads who range far and wide across their ancestral territories, protecting their lands from exploitation and intrusion. They are survivalists who forge tight bonds with family and community and stand firm in the face of danger. Many are skilled hunters, trackers, and warriors who do battle with bow, steel, and hooves. Brave and stubborn, they're willing to challenge even the fiercest foes and largest forces to protect their homes, kin, and the land within their domain.\n\n As hunter-gatherers, centaurs rely upon the bounty of the natural world for sustenance. As youths, they're taught to nurture and respect their surrounding ecosystems so the land remains healthy and bountiful throughout their lives and is preserved for future generations. Centaurs understand that a land exploited or despoiled is a land unfit for survival, just as a herd overhunted dies off. In the ancient past, such carelessness and greed resulted in malnutrition, famine, and loss of territory, and most centaurs are careful not to repeat the mistakes of their distant forbears. Thus, centaurs prefer to adapt to their surroundings, rather than abuse their environments for their own comfort. They're guardians of nature, and their beliefs lead them to clash with careless urbanites and expansionists over exploitative and dangerous practices, including overhunting, overlogging, pollution, and city development.\n\n Centaurs are happiest when mobile, and many feel restless or fall ill if cooped up or sedentary for too long. They're fond of racing and athletics, and are aggressively competitive, always striving to best their previous achievements and to outdo their fellows. This often results in centaurs being judged as contentious and boorish by outsiders. Most centaurs enjoy physical contests, particularly team sports, and award small but valued tokens to victors—though for many centaurs, bragging rights are the greatest prize of all. Not all centaurs compete as athletes, but most centaurs enjoy exertion and take naturally to activities that get their blood pumping and their heart racing.\n\n If you want to play a character who runs free and proud, always looking out for their companions, you should play a centaur.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Centaur01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Centaur02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Go to great lengths to protect your home and the people you love.</li><li>Enjoy competition, particularly organized sports and tests of strength or endurance.</li><li>Respect and value the natural world.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Assume you're an expert archer or fierce warrior.</li><li>Think you understand horses.</li><li>Consider you aggressive and overly competitive.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nCentaurs have the form of muscular humans with the bodies of horses from the waist down. They're hardy and stable, capable of carrying heavy burdens and cumbersome loads for long periods. Centaurs display great variation in their size, hair, and coloration, with most averaging 7 feet tall and weighing over 2,000 pounds. While coloration is often inherited, a centaur's coat markings are unpredictable, and many take pride in the distinct patterns, placements, and chromatic shifts of their coats. These markings are present at birth and don't change over the course of a centaur's life. In ages past, a centaur's markings were used to divine their future. Though this tradition has fallen out of favor since the death of prophecy, some particularly rare markings are still considered lucky or an ill omen today.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nCentaurs are originally from the continent of Casmaron, and most still reside there today, particularly in Iblydos and Iobaria. In Iblydos, many centaurs are agrarian, carefully and sustainably tending farmland and gardens, particularly for wildflowers, olives, figs, and grapes, from which they vinify a beloved (and potent) local wine. Thanks to popular folktales regarding the near-mythical centaurs Elthavus and Ventriadi, famed mentors to numerous ancient Iblydan hero-gods of old, it is traditionally believed that centaurs excel at training heroes. Centaurs have done nothing to dissuade this notion. Most centaurs enjoy the act of mentorship, and aging military leaders, healers, astronomers, engineers, and other experts are often thrilled to pass their knowledge down to younger generations. Thanks to their competitive nature, some centaur teachers compete with one another over who can train the most promising students, soldiers, and intellectuals.\n\n Over the ages, centaurs spread throughout much of the Inner Sea via Iobaria, most notably the Isle of Kortos, where grudges against the citizens of Absalom are long-enduring. There, centaurs wage guerrilla warfare against the constant intruders into their territory and clash with nearby harpies and minotaurs. They range across the lowlands and forests, in alpine meadows, and throughout the Immenwood.\n\n Centaurs maintain large territories that they range through in a nomadic lifestyle, living as mobile communities of hunter-gatherers. These areas are well defined and have been maintained through generations. At the heart of each territory is a centralized location of import. Often a religious site, meeting place, or camp is maintained for sick and the elderly centaurs who can no longer travel with the rest of their band. Occasionally, this camp is a permanent settlement, constructed of wood, limestone, clay bricks, or marble, depending on the region and environment, and surrounded by fields of carefully tended crops or flocks of chickens, goats, or sheep. Centaurs have a passing fondness for animals, but rarely keep domesticated pets and find horses off-putting.\n\n A centaur band is a tight-knit community, led by a respected member of the group who's proven capable, wise, and calm under pressure. Usually, these leaders are middle-aged and older, as centaurs consider life experience a necessary quality in a leader. Rarely, a centaur or band chooses to become sedentary or integrate with a larger nation. These are often small bands whose territories have been destroyed or stolen, emissaries representing their bands, adventurers, loners, outcasts, or even bands who simply can't survive against a superior military enemy. Regardless, this choice is not made lightly, as most centaurs feel constrained in urban environments, particularly in settlements built for people smaller than them.\n\n When built, centaur constructions are large and airy to allow for range of movement. Their buildings are communal, always aboveground, and open to the elements in places—wide doors held open, or roof and wall hatches to allow in light. Most are built of wood, thatch, and mudbrick while in Iblydos, harder materials like marble and stone are more likely. In Iobaria, they often repurpose old cyclopean ruins, which offer plentiful space. In Iobaria, herbalism, medicine, and magical purification are more commonly valued skills, thanks to the incessant plagues and illnesses that are prevalent in the region. A centaur band dare not travel without a few skilled healers, and even hunting parties and scouts rarely split off for long. Centaur healers and herbalists frequently put aside their differences and affiliations to exchange knowledge at annual meetings known as Soothings. There, band representatives from across the nation exchange medical breakthroughs and other knowledge. The largest of these Soothings occurs biannually in Vurnirn, the largest centaur settlement in Iobaria.\n\n In Kaer Maga, Cheliax, Molthune, and Oprak, centaurs have assimilated with the larger nations, sometimes living as citizens and merchants, but more often serving as soldiers and mercenaries. In Garund, centaurs range across plains and savannas. They get along well with other nature-conscious cultures, teaming up with catfolk, tripkees, elves, and orcs to battle demons near Lake Ocota, undead near the borders of Geb and Mzali, and other dangerous threats. Centaurs remain open foes with Taldor and Andoran, remembering well the old wars with the expansionist Taldan empire that drove them into the Verduran Forest. Many in these regions dream of retaking their ancestral territories back from Taldan and Andoran control—a dangerous pipe dream certain to result in the deaths of countless centaurs.\n\n Centaurs believe in reform and often rely on community pressure to discourage harmful behaviors. The unrepentant and the greatest transgressors face exile beyond the band's borders; centaurs avoid ending the lives of their own, except during times of war and mid-battle. While some centaur bands, serving demons and other foul gods, may attack other centaurs, even they prefer to harry other foes.\n\n Centaurs consider saddles and bridles both restricting and shamefully insulting, akin to being shackled and caged. They despise being ridden and refuse to serve as a mount except in the direst of circumstances or emergencies, or only by their most trusted companions.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nThe beliefs of a centaur often depend on where and how they were raised. Many centaurs follow the [Green Faith](/Deities.aspx?ID=298) or worship deities who share their respect for nature, such as [Cernunnos](/Deities.aspx?ID=116), [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=282), or [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284). Others feel kinship with [Desna](/Deities.aspx?ID=281), goddess of travel. Healers and herbalists favor [Immonhiel](/Deities.aspx?ID=238) or [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290). In urban areas, [Kurgess](/Deities.aspx?ID=42) and [Gorum](/Deities.aspx?ID=283) are favorites, depending on the centaur's temperament and profession.\n\n Centaurs have two primary religious figures: Greenspeakers and Faithspeakers. Greenspeakers are one with nature, followers of the Green Faith, exceptional herbalists, and otherwise learned in the ways of the natural world. Faithspeakers are pious devotees of gods, demons, celestials, and other beings. Both are given equal respect, considered two sides of the same coin. Through their Speakers, centaurs interact with the world beyond what they can see and feel, and lead ceremonies, celebrations, and prayers. Celebrations are usually divided into two categories: beginnings and endings, with beginnings such as weddings, births, and spring celebrated at dawn, and endings such as harvests, funerals, and partings celebrated at dusk. Death rites vary by region and culture, but sedentary bands and those who cultivate fields, gardens, or crops, often burn their dead on pyres, releasing their spirits from their material bodies, then using the resulting ashes to fertilize fields or gardens so the dead can continue to serve their community. In regions with rocky ground or frigid climate, centaurs instead bury their dead under cairns and stone mounds.\n\n **Popular Edicts** ensure knowledge is passed on, live in harmony with the natural world, play fair in an honest competition<br /> **Popular Anathema** fail to roam, aid in the wanton destruction of a natural landscape \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nCentaurs enjoy traveling and excitement, and are drawn to a life of adventure, though few enjoy leaving their band. Centaurs commonly adventure to protect their lands and people from outsiders or great evils, to explore new territories, or to act as ambassadors. Many have the [field medic](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=423), [herbalist](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=428), [hunter](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=430), [nomad](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=436), [scout](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=441), or soldier background. Centaurs who favor combat most often become [fighters](/Classes.aspx?ID=7) or [rangers](/Classes.aspx?ID=9), while Faithspeakers and Greenspeakers are more likely to be [clerics](/Classes.aspx?ID=5), [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6), [oracles](/Classes.aspx?ID=14), or [witches](/Classes.aspx?ID=16). While some centaur healers are [alchemists](/Classes.aspx?ID=1), it's more likely a centaur adopts the [herbalist](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=62) or [medic](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=69) archetype.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nCentaurs have a single name and sometimes earn an appellation through their deeds, appearance, or personality traits, such as Thunderhoof or Windrunner. When beyond their territorial borders, centaurs use their band's name as an additional identifier. Centaurs who settle in other nations either adopt their band name as a last name or create a unique last name of their own, founding a lineage that's passed down to future generations.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Sample Names</title>\r\nAecora, Demeleon, Ertris, Hycanthe, Irdan, Jalvayne, Karala, Malion, Oridius, Tolron, Vorag\n<title level=\"2\">Centaur Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nLarge\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n30 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nStrength, Wisdom, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nCharisma\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

and the people you love. enjoy competition, particularly organized sports and tests of strength or endurance. respect and value the natural world. others probably... assume you're an expert archer or fierce warrior. think you understand horses. consider you aggressive and overly competitive. physical description centaurs have the form of muscular humans with the bodies of horses from the waist down. they're hardy and stable, capable of carrying heavy burdens and cumbersome loads for long periods. centaurs display great variation in their size, hair, and coloration, with most averaging 7 feet tall and weighing over 2,000 pounds. while coloration is often inherited, a centaur's coat markings are unpredictable, and many take pride in the distinct patterns, placements, and chromatic shifts of their coats. these markings are present at birth and don't change over the course of a centaur's life. in ages past, a centaur's markings were used to divine their future. though this tradition has fallen out of favor since the death of prophecy, some particularly rare markings are still considered lucky or an ill omen today. society centaurs are originally from the continent of casmaron, and most still reside there today, particularly in iblydos and iobaria. in iblydos, many centaurs are agrarian, carefully and sustainably tending farmland and gardens, particularly for wildflowers, olives, figs, and grapes, from which they vinify a beloved (and potent) local wine. thanks to popular folktales regarding the near-mythical centaurs elthavus and ventriadi, famed mentors to numerous ancient iblydan hero-gods of old, it is traditionally believed that centaurs excel at training heroes. centaurs have done nothing to dissuade this notion. most centaurs enjoy the act of mentorship, and aging military leaders, healers, astronomers, engineers, and other experts are often thrilled to pass their knowledge down to younger generations. thanks to their competitive nature, some centaur teachers compete with one another over who can train the most promising students, soldiers, and intellectuals. over the ages, centaurs spread throughout much of the inner sea via iobaria, most notably the isle of kortos, where grudges against the citizens of absalom are long-enduring. there, centaurs wage guerrilla warfare against the constant intruders into their territory and clash with nearby harpies and minotaurs. they range across the lowlands and forests, in alpine meadows, and throughout the immenwood. centaurs maintain large territories that they range through in a nomadic lifestyle, living as mobile communities of hunter-gatherers. these areas are well defined and have been maintained through generations. at the heart of each territory is a centralized location of import. often a religious site, meeting place, or camp is maintained for sick and the elderly centaurs who can no longer travel with the rest of their band. occasionally, this camp is a permanent settlement, constructed of wood, limestone, clay bricks, or marble, depending on the region and environment, and surrounded by fields of carefully tended crops or flocks of chickens, goats, or sheep. centaurs have a passing fondness for animals, but rarely keep domesticated pets and find horses off-putting. a centaur band is a tight-knit community, led by a respected member of the group who's proven capable, wise, and calm under pressure. usually, these leaders are middle-aged and older, as centaurs consider life experience a necessary quality in a leader. rarely, a centaur or band chooses to become sedentary or integrate with a larger nation. these are often small bands whose territories have been destroyed or stolen, emissaries representing their bands, adventurers, loners, outcasts, or even bands who simply can't survive against a superior military enemy. regardless, this choice is not made lightly, as most centaurs feel constrained in urban environments, particularly in settlements built for people smaller than them. when built, centaur constructions are large and airy to allow for range of movement. their buildings are communal, always aboveground, and open to the elements in places—wide doors held open, or roof and wall hatches to allow in light. most are built of wood, thatch, and mudbrick while in iblydos, harder materials like marble and stone are more likely. in iobaria, they often repurpose old cyclopean ruins, which offer plentiful space. in iobaria, herbalism, medicine, and magical purification are more commonly valued skills, thanks to the incessant plagues and illnesses that are prevalent in the region. a centaur band dare not travel without a few skilled healers, and even hunting parties and scouts rarely split off for long. centaur healers and herbalists frequently put aside their differences and affiliations to exchange knowledge at annual meetings known as soothings. there, band representatives from across the nation exchange medical breakthroughs and other knowledge. the largest of these soothings occurs biannually in vurnirn, the largest centaur settlement in iobaria. in kaer maga, cheliax, molthune, and oprak, centaurs have assimilated with the larger nations, sometimes living as citizens and merchants, but more often serving as soldiers and mercenaries. in garund, centaurs range across plains and savannas. they get along well with other nature-conscious cultures, teaming up with catfolk, tripkees, elves, and orcs to battle demons near lake ocota, undead near the borders of geb and mzali, and other dangerous threats. centaurs remain open foes with taldor and andoran, remembering well the old wars with the expansionist taldan empire that drove them into the verduran forest. many in these regions dream of retaking their ancestral territories back from taldan and andoran control—a dangerous pipe dream certain to result in the deaths of countless centaurs. centaurs believe in reform and often rely on community pressure to discourage harmful behaviors. the unrepentant and the greatest transgressors face exile beyond the band's borders; centaurs avoid ending the lives of their own, except during times of war and mid-battle. while some centaur bands, serving demons and other foul gods, may attack other centaurs, even they prefer to harry other foes. centaurs consider saddles and bridles both restricting and shamefully insulting, akin to being shackled and caged. they despise being ridden and refuse to serve as a mount except in the direst of circumstances or emergencies, or only by their most trusted companions. alignment and religion the beliefs of a centaur often depend on where and how they were raised. many centaurs follow the green faith or worship deities who share their respect for nature, such as cernunnos, erastil, or gozreh. others feel kinship with desna, goddess of travel. healers and herbalists favor immonhiel or pharasma. in urban areas, kurgess and gorum are favorites, depending on the centaur's temperament and profession. centaurs have two primary religious figures: greenspeakers and faithspeakers. greenspeakers are one with nature, followers of the green faith, exceptional herbalists, and otherwise learned in the ways of the natural world. faithspeakers are pious devotees of gods, demons, celestials, and other beings. both are given equal respect, considered two sides of the same coin. through their speakers, centaurs interact with the world beyond what they can see and feel, and lead ceremonies, celebrations, and prayers. celebrations are usually divided into two categories: beginnings and endings, with beginnings such as weddings, births, and spring celebrated at dawn, and endings such as harvests, funerals, and partings celebrated at dusk. death rites vary by region and culture, but sedentary bands and those who cultivate fields, gardens, or crops, often burn their dead on pyres, releasing their spirits from their material bodies, then using the resulting ashes to fertilize fields or gardens so the dead can continue to serve their community. in regions with rocky ground or frigid climate, centaurs instead bury their dead under cairns and stone mounds. popular edicts ensure knowledge is passed on, live in harmony with the natural world, play fair in an honest competition popular anathema fail to roam, aid in the wanton destruction of a natural landscape adventurers centaurs enjoy traveling and excitement, and are drawn to a life of adventure, though few enjoy leaving their band. centaurs commonly adventure to protect their lands and people from outsiders or great evils, to explore new territories, or to act as ambassadors. many have the field medic, herbalist, hunter, nomad, scout, or soldier background. centaurs who favor combat most often become fighters or rangers, while faithspeakers and greenspeakers are more likely to be clerics, druids, oracles, or witches. while some centaur healers are alchemists, it's more likely a centaur adopts the herbalist or medic archetype. names centaurs have a single name and sometimes earn an appellation through their deeds, appearance, or personality traits, such as thunderhoof or windrunner. when beyond their territorial borders, centaurs use their band's name as an additional identifier. centaurs who settle in other nations either adopt their band name as a last name or create a unique last name of their own, founding a lineage that's passed down to future generations. sample names aecora, demeleon, ertris, hycanthe, irdan,

Dhampirs enjoy long life spans and otherworldly charm, but their ghostly pallor and the nature of their parentage make their lives in humanoid societies difficult._\r\n\r\nMany call vampires the children of the night, but it's dhampirs who can truly claim that title. These mortal offspring of vampires walk the line between life and undeath not just physiologically, but also in their social standing, temperament, and worldview. The circumstances surrounding a dhampir's birth are rare, complex, and often shrouded in horrific rumors. Some dhampirs are the child of one mortal and one vampiric parent, while others are born to those who were turned into vampires while pregnant. Still others rise from occult rituals or other supernatural influences that impose a vampiric curse onto a mortal infant. The life of a dhampir is often difficult; few vampiric parents have the inclination to raise a mortal child, while mortal communities find a dhampir's sallow flesh, piercing eyes, and unnerving presence off-putting at best. \n\nDespite being living creatures, dhampirs respond to vitality and void energy as if they were undead, making them unwelcome in many holy communities and often driving them toward necromantic arts. Dhampirs aren't immortal, but age far more slowly than most mortals, with a lifespan similar to that of an elf. Dhampirs have difficulty producing children of their own, and those few born to a dhampir are never dhampirs themselves. A dhampir generally resembles a member of their non-vampire parent's ancestry, but with a ghostly pallor and eyes so light it seems they have only pinpoint pupils and no iris. All dhampirs have elongated incisors, some nearly as long as those of a true vampire. Many command grace, beauty, and charm despite their unsettling appearance.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Dhampir01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Dhampir02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Distance yourself from your heritage by trying to blend into society or even hunting undead.</li><li>Take special precautions to avoid being exposed to “helpful” healing magic.</li><li>Find yourself fascinated by the sight, smell, or taste of blood.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Feel unsettled by your ghostly pallor and sharp teeth.</li><li>Wonder about or even romanticize your origins and motivations.</li><li>Find themselves strangely drawn to your grace, charm, and appearance.</li></ul>\n<title level=\"2\">Dhampir Heritage Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\nYou are the scion of a [vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=480), half living and half [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=722), gifted with uncanny charm and grace, a bloodless pallor, and elongated incisors.

Many of these “half-orcs” refer to themselves as “dromaars,” an orcish word referring to those drummers whose music sends the hordes marching to war, seeing themselves as heralds of a new age for orcs in the Inner Sea region. Some intolerant humanoids see orcs as more akin to monsters than people, hating and fearing them simply due to their lineage. This can push dromaars to the margins of society, where some find work in manual labor, as mercenaries, or in crime. Many who can't stand the indignities heaped on them in human society find a home among their orc kin or trek into the wilderness.\n\n Some humans assume dromaars are less intelligent or uncivilized, and dromaars rarely find acceptance among societies with many such folk. To an orc hold, a dromaar is often considered a valuable addition, making up for anything they might lack in physical strength with gifts inherited from their other ancestral line. While some dromaars struggle to claim a name for themselves in the unforgiving hierarchies of orc holds, others may find that orcish society is far more tolerant and can create opportunities to rise high.\n\n A dromaar with a human parent can typically live to around 70 years old.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/HalfOrc01.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Ignore, embrace, or actively counter the common stereotypes about dromaars.</li><li>Make the most of your size and strength, either physically or socially.</li><li>Keep your distance from people of most other ancestries, in case they unfairly reject you due to your orc ancestors.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Assume you enjoy and excel at fighting but aren't inclined toward magical or intellectual pursuits.</li><li>Pity you for the tragic circumstances they assume were involved in your birth.</li><li>Get out of your way and back down rather than face your anger.</li></ul>\n<title level=\"2\">Dromaar Heritage Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\nOrcish strength emboldens your bloodline.

They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair and beards, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of maturity and honor among many dwarf clans.\n\n Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming-of-age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nThough the ancient dwarven empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, dwarves today retain many of the qualities that once propelled them to greatness: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in their endeavors. Dwarves live within mountain Sky Citadels dotted over the surface, which can create vast cultural divides between dwarf clans. Yet nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and family.\n\n Few dwarves are seen without their [clan dagger](/Weapons.aspx?ID=13) strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and is distinctive to their clan. Dwarves honor their children with names of ancestors or dwarven heroes. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nDwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder—especially when strong ale is involved.

See you as stubborn, though whether this is an asset or a detriment changes from moment to moment. Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends. Physical Description Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair and beards, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of maturity and honor among many dwarf clans. Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming-of-age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old. Society Though the ancient dwarven empire fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies, dwarves today retain many of the qualities that once propelled them to greatness: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in their endeavors. Dwarves live within mountain Sky Citadels dotted over the surface, which can create vast cultural divides between dwarf clans. Yet nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and family. Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and is distinctive to their clan. Dwarves honor their children with names of ancestors or dwarven heroes. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics. Alignment and Religion Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder—especially when strong ale is involved.

Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.\n\n Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nGoblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.\n\n Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as “longshanks,” won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nEven the most well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning goblin adventurers are often unsure whether they're on the right side of the law. Organized worship likewise confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating— sometimes even attributing deific status to fellow goblins of note. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of [Cayden Cailean](/Deities.aspx?ID=4).\n\n **Popular Edicts** invent songs for every occasion, turn trash into your treasures, solve problems with fire<br /> **Popular Anathema** trust a dog or horse, learn to read\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nAk, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini\n<title level=\"2\">Goblin Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n6\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nSmall\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nDexterity, Charisma, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nWisdom\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n[Goblin](/Languages.aspx?ID=6)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter. Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as “longshanks,” won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Alignment and Religion Even the most well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning goblin adventurers are often unsure whether they're on the right side of the law. Organized worship likewise confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating— sometimes even attributing deific status to fellow goblins of note. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.

description goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. goblins average 3 feet tall. most are bald, with little or no body hair. their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune. goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.

their goblin kin, often arranging themselves into military structures._\r\n\r\nTaller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Hobgoblin01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Hobgoblin02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Seek out the most effective and practical solutions to any problem.</li><li>Encourage a clear chain of command among any group you travel with, following orders even if you disagree with them.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation and intimidating appearance.</li><li>Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication, and discipline.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nHobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. They're remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty.\n\n Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk, and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nHobgoblins structure their society after military hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms.

The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas.

Physical Description Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. They're remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty. Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk, and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age. Society Hobgoblins structure their society after military hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms.

spots and stripes are both common. kholos typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. women are usually about a head taller than men and correspondingly stronger. kholos are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average. society kholos generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. they are ruled by a council of female kholos who are typically selected from the elders of each family. bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods— they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan. alignment and religion kholos have an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to life and prioritize results over methods. they are usually loyal and generous to their people and ruthless toward outsiders—whether this behavior is considered acceptable varies depending on who they view as “their people.” many kholos pay homage to lamashtu, both as the originator of their people and a guide in a chaotic world. however, some kholos often give homage to calistria and shelyn. nethys is the patron of bonekeepers. popular edicts strengthen your allies and packmates, recount the tales of your ancestors, neutralize foes with tactics and cunning popular anathema risk yourself or your packmates for no reason, let a dead kholo or loved one rot like carrion names newborn kholos are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never hyena, as this is considered narcissistic). as a kholo reaches certain milestones in their life, they add descriptors to their name. sample names baobab, jackal, onyx elephant in shadows, red thorn, unbent iron reed, white acacia, wistful tooth, woodpecker kholo mechanics hit points 8 size medium speed 25 feet attribute boosts strength, intelligence, free attribute flaws wisdom languages common kholo additional languages equal to your intelligence modifier (if it's positive). choose from draconic, elven, fey, iruxi, necril, orcish, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region). bite your sharp teeth and powerful jaws are fearsome weapons. you have a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage. your jaws are in the brawling group. low-light vision you can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light."},{"attribute":["Dexterity","Charisma","Free"],"attribute_flaw":["Constitution"],"category":"ancestry","exclude_from_search":false,"hp":6,"hp_raw":"6","id":"ancestry-80","image":["/Images/Ancestries/Kobold01.webp","/Images/Ancestries/Kobold02.webp"],"language":["Common","Sakvroth"],"language_markdown":"[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155), [Sakvroth](/Languages.aspx?ID=118)","legacy_id":["ancestry-18"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Ancestry\" pfs=\"\">[Kobold](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=80)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Kobold\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=759\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 20 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_Kobolds are small and reptilian, with features marked by the power they choose to follow._\r\n\r\nEvery kobold instinctively understands the importance of power, and many are inclined to venerate those who have it, whether they be mighty dragons, cruel fiends, imperious fey, or even ancient artifacts.

nature temporarily granted physical forms. As guardians and emissaries of the environment, leshies are “born” when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, though it isn't uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators. Many leshies relish the opportunity to interact with the physical world. While most leshy spirits are ancient, they rarely recall past lifetimes and see their new life as a chance to experience the wonders of the world once more.\n\n If you want to play a character who is curious and connected to nature, you should play a leshy.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Leshy01.png\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Leshy02.png\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Leshy03.png\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Leshy04.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories.</li><li>Encourage civilizations to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Think you are a curiosity due to your spiritual origins.</li><li>Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nLeshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Leshies begin their lives as adults and don't age.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nTo most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return.\n\n Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.

Leshies are immortal spirits of nature temporarily granted physical forms. As guardians and emissaries of the environment, leshies are “born” when a skilled druid or other master of primal magic conducts a ritual to create a suitable vessel, and then a spirit chooses that vessel to be their temporary home. Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, though it isn't uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators. Many leshies relish the opportunity to interact with the physical world. While most leshy spirits are ancient, they rarely recall past lifetimes and see their new life as a chance to experience the wonders of the world once more. If you want to play a character who is curious and connected to nature, you should play a leshy. You Might... Act as a traveling agent for natural guardians who are unable to leave their territories. Encourage civilizations to cooperate with nature and build their cities in ecologically friendly ways. Others Probably... Think you are a curiosity due to your spiritual origins. Assume you know only about nature and are unfamiliar with civilization and society. Physical Description Leshies are as varied as the material used to create their vessels, usually appearing as a bizarre mishmash of various plants or fungi. Their bodies are vaguely humanoid in shape, with numerous characteristics of the plant or fungus from which they were made. A typical leshy is about 3 feet tall. Leshies begin their lives as adults and don't age. Society To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely. Leshies choose and change their names multiple times throughout their lives. Alignment and Religion Leshies' beliefs generally focus on the natural world. Those with a philosophical bent lean toward the Green Faith, and Gozreh is the most popular deity among faithful leshies. Some leshies also venerate green men, powerful spirits of nature.

From the waist up, merfolk have the bodies of humanoids with powerful bodies and sharp, aquadynamic features. Their eyes are a little larger than those of a human, and many have slightly pointed ears, similar to those of aiuvarins. Below the waist, merfolk have the bodies of great fish, each with a long, scaled tail ending in a fin or pair of fins.\n\n Merfolk come in every color of skin and scale imaginable. Most often, their human bodies have skin tones similar to those of humans or elves living in the same area—the merfolk of the Shackles, for instance, bear a certain similarity to the Lirgeni, while those who live in the Steaming Sea somewhat resemble their Ulfen neighbors. Merfolk who dwell farther from land take on colorations closer to fish tones of blue, gray, or even green. Deep-sea abyssal merfolk have dark gray, midnight blue, or even translucent skin.\n\n Merfolk fish tails are colored similarly to local fish populations. In the temperate zones where most merfolk live, they have iridescent, silvery bodies with traces of gray or blue; tropical merfolk might display patterns of brilliant colors, while those born in the depths might have translucent scales or faintly bioluminescent stripes.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nMerfolk can be found in the corners of every ocean, but the largest concentration lives in sprawling aquatic kingdoms on continental shelves, usually in temperate waters teeming with fish. Merfolk look at the deep water in roughly the same way that surface dwellers look at mountains or deserts: some people can live there, but it isn't exactly ideal terrain. Merfolk territories consist of several settled villages and cities, sometimes organized under aristocratic families with courtly politics to rival those found in any Inner Sea monarchy. These political entities pursue active diplomacy with one another, making alliances and trade treaties. Many tend to be more standoffish toward surface dwellers, but some are fascinated by the surface and actively seek to learn about it, whether by using specialized water-filled mobility devices to come onshore or through ancient transformation magics.\n\n Merfolk value magic very highly, and any merfolk hoping to rise to a leadership role is expected to have a powerful grasp of the sorcery of wind, wave, and song. Merfolk kings and queens aren't necessarily the most powerful mages in their territories, but they're usually not far from it, as they have access to a wealth of teachings and artifacts passed down from one generation to the next.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nIn general, merfolk follow the morals and customs of their parents and the communities in which they were raised. These vary greatly throughout the world. For instance, some merfolk are expected to live harmoniously with nature, while others follow a rigid set of laws ordained by their ancestors. Many merfolk believe that acts of altruism raise a community as a whole, even if they don't immediately produce beneficial results for the one who performed the deed in the first place.\n\n Merfolk worship is, like their societies, diverse. Deities with control over water are placed in high regard, and most communities have a shrine to [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284) or one of the Elemental Lords of Water: [Kelizandri](/Deities.aspx?ID=104) or [Lysianassa](/Deities.aspx?ID=105). [Abadar](/Deities.aspx?ID=277) is a popular god in some larger merfolk settlements, and a version of [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=282)—more associated with sharks than with stags—is worshipped in smaller villages.\n\n **Popular Edicts** aid one's neighbor whenever possible, bring the beauty of music to the world, protect the seas from threats within and without<br /> **Popular Anathema** fight the current head-on, use magic to harm innocents or hoard wealth \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nMerfolk become adventurers for all sorts of reasons, but one thing is certain—the decision to leave home, especially to go and live above the waves, is never taken lightly. Some merfolk adventure to defend their homes or forge alliances with other peoples, while other merfolk are exiles, banished for crimes they might or might not have committed. And of course, some merfolk are just curious about the surface world.\n\n Merfolk come from all kinds of backgrounds— adventurous merfolk might come from the [artisan](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=409), [guard](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=427), [sailor](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=439), or [warrior](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=445) backgrounds, and merfolk have their share of [emissaries](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=420) and [nobles](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=435) as well. With their affinity for magic, many merfolk become [wizards](/Classes.aspx?ID=12), [witches](/Classes.aspx?ID=16), or [magi](/Classes.aspx?ID=17). Less magically inclined merfolk are more likely to become [fighters](/Classes.aspx?ID=7) (having trained in the local militia) or occasionally [rangers](/Classes.aspx?ID=9), bonding with sharks or other sea life.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nMerfolk have as many naming patterns as there are merfolk cultures, but a few tendencies predominate. Dolphin-like clicks and whale-like groans punctuate mellifluous merfolk names, and variances in pitch and tone help distinguish similar names from one another. Merfolk who regularly deal with surface dwellers often adopt names borrowed from local surface cultures, especially since merfolk names tend to sound strange and awkward to their own ears when pronounced in air rather than water.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Sample Names</title>\r\nAloori, Iri'kik, Ouliette, T'konaa, Uathanak\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Other Information</title>\r\n<title level=\"3\">Outsea</title> By far the strangest community connected to merfolk is that of Outsea, a mid-sized town in the middle of the River Kingdoms, hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean. Long ago, an aquatic mercenary company forged far inlands, only to find that their magic failed them at a critical moment. To everyone’s surprise, they survived and now reside in a magically maintained lake of salt water in the middle of Avistan.\n\nOutsea is home to not just merfolk but also sedacthies, azarketi, nagas, and several other aquatic species. They’re ruled by a military junta, the Council of Generals, and by Danglosa, an anglerfish claiming to be a demigod. The inhabitants are quite martial but also far more comfortable dealing with the surface world than basically any merfolk anywhere else; it’s fair to say that Outsea merfolk are considered unusual by other merfolk.\n<title level=\"2\">Merfolk Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nDexterity, Charisma, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nConstitution\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Thalassic](/Languages.aspx?ID=113)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

tropical merfolk might display patterns of brilliant colors, while those born in the depths might have translucent scales or faintly bioluminescent stripes. society merfolk can be found in the corners of every ocean, but the largest concentration lives in sprawling aquatic kingdoms on continental shelves, usually in temperate waters teeming with fish. merfolk look at the deep water in roughly the same way that surface dwellers look at mountains or deserts: some people can live there, but it isn't exactly ideal terrain. merfolk territories consist of several settled villages and cities, sometimes organized under aristocratic families with courtly politics to rival those found in any inner sea monarchy. these political entities pursue active diplomacy with one another, making alliances and trade treaties. many tend to be more standoffish toward surface dwellers, but some are fascinated by the surface and actively seek to learn about it, whether by using specialized water-filled mobility devices to come onshore or through ancient transformation magics. merfolk value magic very highly, and any merfolk hoping to rise to a leadership role is expected to have a powerful grasp of the sorcery of wind, wave, and song. merfolk kings and queens aren't necessarily the most powerful mages in their territories, but they're usually not far from it, as they have access to a wealth of teachings and artifacts passed down from one generation to the next. alignment and religion in general, merfolk follow the morals and customs of their parents and the communities in which they were raised. these vary greatly throughout the world. for instance, some merfolk are expected to live harmoniously with nature, while others follow a rigid set of laws ordained by their ancestors. many merfolk believe that acts of altruism raise a community as a whole, even if they don't immediately produce beneficial results for the one who performed the deed in the first place. merfolk worship is, like their societies, diverse. deities with control over water are placed in high regard, and most communities have a shrine to gozreh or one of the elemental lords of water: kelizandri or lysianassa. abadar is a popular god in some larger merfolk settlements, and a version of erastil—more associated with sharks than with stags—is worshipped in smaller villages. popular edicts aid one's neighbor whenever possible, bring the beauty of music to the world, protect the seas from threats within and without popular anathema fight the current head-on, use magic to harm innocents or hoard wealth adventurers merfolk become adventurers for all sorts of reasons, but one thing is certain—the decision to leave home, especially to go and live above the waves, is never taken lightly. some merfolk adventure to defend their homes or forge alliances with other peoples, while other merfolk are exiles, banished for crimes they might or might not have committed. and of course, some merfolk are just curious about the surface world. merfolk come from all kinds of backgrounds— adventurous merfolk might come from the artisan, guard, sailor, or warrior backgrounds, and merfolk have their share of emissaries and nobles as well. with their affinity for magic, many merfolk become wizards, witches, or magi. less magically inclined merfolk are more likely to become fighters (having trained in the local militia) or occasionally rangers, bonding with sharks or other sea life. names merfolk have as many naming patterns as there are merfolk cultures, but a few tendencies predominate. dolphin-like clicks and whale-like groans punctuate mellifluous merfolk names, and variances in pitch and tone help distinguish similar names from one another. merfolk who regularly deal with surface dwellers often adopt names borrowed from local surface cultures, especially since merfolk names tend to sound strange and awkward to their own ears when pronounced in air rather than water. sample names aloori, iri'kik, ouliette, t'konaa, uathanak other information outsea by far the strangest community connected to merfolk is that of outsea, a mid-sized town in the middle of the river kingdoms, hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean. long ago, an aquatic mercenary company forged far inlands, only to find that their magic failed them at a critical moment. to everyone’s surprise, they survived and now reside in a magically maintained lake of salt water in the middle of avistan. outsea is home to not just merfolk but also sedacthies, azarketi, nagas, and several other aquatic species. they’re ruled by a military junta, the council of generals, and by danglosa, an anglerfish claiming to be a demigod. the inhabitants are quite martial but also far more comfortable dealing with the surface world than basically any merfolk anywhere else; it’s fair to say that outsea merfolk are considered unusual by other merfolk. merfolk mechanics hit points 8 size medium speed attribute boosts dexterity, charisma, free attribute flaws constitution languages common thalassic additional languages equal to your intelligence modifier (if it's positive). choose from aklo, azlanti, draconic, elven, and fey, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region). aquatic grace when you roll a success on a saving throw against a water effect, you get a critical success instead. low-light vision you can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light. hydration your body requires you to return to aquatic environments at least once in a 24-hour period. after the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a –1 status penalty to fortitude saves. after 48 hours, you struggle to breathe air and begin to suffocate until returned to water."},{"attribute":["Strength","Constitution","Free"],"attribute_flaw":["Charisma"],"category":"ancestry","exclude_from_search":false,"hp":10,"hp_raw":"10","id":"ancestry-75","image":["/Images/Ancestries/Minotaur01.webp","/Images/Ancestries/Minotaur02.webp"],"language":["Common","Jotun"],"language_markdown":"[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155), [Jotun](/Languages.aspx?ID=162)","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Ancestry\" pfs=\"\">[Minotaur](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=75)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Beast\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=20\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=91\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Minotaur\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=788\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Howl of the Wild](/Sources.aspx?ID=226) pg. 40 <sup>2.1</sup>\n\n_Minotaurs are horned, bovine humanoids who originate from an ancient divine curse.

Though sometimes mistaken for simple brutes, minotaurs have scholars and warriors alike. Those who can look past their appearance will find an affinity for building and navigation, as well as creative problem-solving.\n\n The myth many minotaurs tell of their origins is one of craft, curses, and misunderstanding. Millennia ago, Iblydos was filled with living deities who walked among and ruled the mortal people. A stonemason named Tavdrinos, admired by mortals and hero-gods alike, received a vision from a hero-god to create a glorious temple, though the myth doesn't name which one. The mason found the images of the vision murky: scrambled glimpses of twisting columns, charging bulls, and a defiant stand made by an unknown figure. It was hardly a detailed commission, but one does not refuse a divine order. The mason labored for 17 years before his task was done. The three-story temple celebrated the glory of the hero-god and their sacred animal, the bull. Upon the hero-god's arrival, Tavdrinos expected to be met with praise and congratulations, but the deity flew into a rage instead. Tavdrinos had misunderstood the vision, for the bull was a hated beast, not a celebrated ally. As punishment for this accidental insult, the hero-god cursed Tavdrinos with the hated shape of the bull. Angered by both the curse and his failure to please the deity, the mason retreated to a series of caves under the temple, where he continued his work as the first minotaur.\n\n If you want to play a character with strength of body, who expresses themselves through craft more than words, you should play a minotaur.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Minotaur01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Minotaur02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Decorate your hooves and horns with designs or colors of personal significance.</li><li>Be adept at navigation and puzzles.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Be intimidated by your size or think you calculating.</li><li>Think you can see through stone.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nMinotaurs are tall, bulky humanoids with the bovine features such as horns, hooves, and elongated faces. Their fur patterns are frequently monotone in deep browns or blacks, though white or gray aren't uncommon. Though the large size of a minotaur might cause one think they are clumsy, the truth is quite the opposite. Minotaur hooves rest on a delicate balance point, making their footfalls quiet and precise. However, when there is a need to be heard, the steps of a minotaur can fall like thunder.\n\n A minotaur's horns are a source of pride and often accented by pieces of fashion. Those with longer horns add rings and chains around them, cast in whatever rare metals are affordable, or dye or engrave patterns along them. Those with not much horn to speak of instead shave their fur around the base of the horns, possibly adding stylish circular tattoos to the surrounding skin or fitting metal caps onto their tips. This draws attention to an otherwise overlooked feature.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nMinotaurs typically reside within insular, subterranean communal enclaves. They take great pride in their architectural prowess, hewing buildings out of stone and natural caves alike. An enclave often has almost twice as many buildings as it needs, with the extra structures serving as functional art. Young minotaurs practice their hunting and stalking skills in the empty buildings, with each generation adding a small expansion or fresco on the walls. Expansions like twisting hallways, unexpected overhangs, shared gardens, and a variety of other such contrivances create numerous social spaces and quiet areas for calm reflection, so long as the traveler is able to keep from becoming lost by the unusual architectural flow.\n\n Myths surrounding minotaurs lead most to believe they are fierce carnivores, or even cannibals in the darkest of legends. In reality, most minotaur societies are hunter-gatherers, feeding off lichen and other flora. Their reputation as fierce hunters stems from monthly rituals, when the most accomplished stalkers venture out and bring back dangerous prey. The return of these hunters is one of the few occasions minotaurs indulge in meat, feasting on the kills as a show of gratitude and reverence for the hunters' skills.\n\n Minotaurs tend to be blunt and literal, rarely engaging in overly clever wordplay, sarcasm, or irony. Flaring nostrils and rolling eyes can be intimidating expressions when viewed by non-minotaurs, but to a minotaur, they can convey a complex story with emotional and even spiritual elements. Minotaurs wishing to emphasize a certain emotion occasionally use piercings and tattoos, though minotaurs who lean too heavily into these adornments to look fierce often come off as a bit foolish to their peers. The minotaur saying “an angry bull stamps once and gores twice” is both an admonition against overly aggressive displays and a reminder that the creature truly to be feared is one who speaks with their actions.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nLong traditions of isolation have resulted in most minotaurs taking an evenhanded approach to events. Many tend toward an unbiased outlook that allows for adaptation. Those who have poor interactions with other humanoids, particularly those met with violence or intolerance, might choose to recede into a chosen lair, ruin, or fortification that they guard fiercely, which sadly perpetuates the tales of brutal minotaurs.\n\n Minotaurs raised by their own people tend to avoid association with deities of any stripe—little surprise given their creation legend. Divine beings are thought of as petty and uncaring, if not by intent then by the sheer magnitude of their power. Many minotaurs adopt logical or spiritual philosophies as a way of reconciling their existence. Mysteries are puzzles yet unanswered, ones that can be explained with careful thought and study.

He now resides in a lavish compound called the Taurean Embassy, from which he attempts to rekindle ties with his enclave.

through craft more than words, you should play a minotaur. you might... decorate your hooves and horns with designs or colors of personal significance. be adept at navigation and puzzles. others probably... be intimidated by your size or think you calculating. think you can see through stone. physical description minotaurs are tall, bulky humanoids with the bovine features such as horns, hooves, and elongated faces. their fur patterns are frequently monotone in deep browns or blacks, though white or gray aren't uncommon. though the large size of a minotaur might cause one think they are clumsy, the truth is quite the opposite. minotaur hooves rest on a delicate balance point, making their footfalls quiet and precise. however, when there is a need to be heard, the steps of a minotaur can fall like thunder. a minotaur's horns are a source of pride and often accented by pieces of fashion. those with longer horns add rings and chains around them, cast in whatever rare metals are affordable, or dye or engrave patterns along them. those with not much horn to speak of instead shave their fur around the base of the horns, possibly adding stylish circular tattoos to the surrounding skin or fitting metal caps onto their tips. this draws attention to an otherwise overlooked feature. society minotaurs typically reside within insular, subterranean communal enclaves. they take great pride in their architectural prowess, hewing buildings out of stone and natural caves alike. an enclave often has almost twice as many buildings as it needs, with the extra structures serving as functional art. young minotaurs practice their hunting and stalking skills in the empty buildings, with each generation adding a small expansion or fresco on the walls. expansions like twisting hallways, unexpected overhangs, shared gardens, and a variety of other such contrivances create numerous social spaces and quiet areas for calm reflection, so long as the traveler is able to keep from becoming lost by the unusual architectural flow. myths surrounding minotaurs lead most to believe they are fierce carnivores, or even cannibals in the darkest of legends. in reality, most minotaur societies are hunter-gatherers, feeding off lichen and other flora. their reputation as fierce hunters stems from monthly rituals, when the most accomplished stalkers venture out and bring back dangerous prey. the return of these hunters is one of the few occasions minotaurs indulge in meat, feasting on the kills as a show of gratitude and reverence for the hunters' skills. minotaurs tend to be blunt and literal, rarely engaging in overly clever wordplay, sarcasm, or irony. flaring nostrils and rolling eyes can be intimidating expressions when viewed by non-minotaurs, but to a minotaur, they can convey a complex story with emotional and even spiritual elements. minotaurs wishing to emphasize a certain emotion occasionally use piercings and tattoos, though minotaurs who lean too heavily into these adornments to look fierce often come off as a bit foolish to their peers. the minotaur saying “an angry bull stamps once and gores twice” is both an admonition against overly aggressive displays and a reminder that the creature truly to be feared is one who speaks with their actions. alignment and religion long traditions of isolation have resulted in most minotaurs taking an evenhanded approach to events. many tend toward an unbiased outlook that allows for adaptation. those who have poor interactions with other humanoids, particularly those met with violence or intolerance, might choose to recede into a chosen lair, ruin, or fortification that they guard fiercely, which sadly perpetuates the tales of brutal minotaurs. minotaurs raised by their own people tend to avoid association with deities of any stripe—little surprise given their creation legend. divine beings are thought of as petty and uncaring, if not by intent then by the sheer magnitude of their power. many minotaurs adopt logical or spiritual philosophies as a way of reconciling their existence. mysteries are puzzles yet unanswered, ones that can be explained with careful thought and study. when minotaurs decide to follow deities, they're primarily drawn to those concerned with self-improvement and self-control, like irori and nethys. popular edicts construct architecture of lasting beauty, seek out ever more perplexing puzzles, hone one's prowess popular anathema leave fate to godly hands rather than mortal initiative, pass up the chance to investigate a mystery adventurers minotaurs have a reputation for being fearsome melee combatants. while this can be true, and there's no shortage of barbarians or fighters among minotaur adventurers, a minotaur can do very well in many classes. the keen mind and love of puzzles produces many an investigator and wizard, while minotaurs with a taste for the unique find themselves walking the path of an inventor or thaumaturge. the ancestry's affinity for earth and stone can also lead them to join the ranks of druids or sorcerers of the elemental bloodline. those who wield the divine typically do so by honing inherent power as sorcerers or oracles rather than by supplicating to a higher entity as clerics or witches. names iblydan minotaurs often have names similar to the names of humans from that archipelago. minotaur surnames are ever-changing, typically reflecting the most memorable achievement an individual has accomplished. until adulthood, an iblydan minotaur bears the surname tavdrinos (after the first minotaur). once they reach maturity, their childhood friends and allies collectively bestow a fitting surname. minotaurs in adventuring groups might be renamed multiple times by their allies. sample names actilea, iraiasos, paxaidio, rotherion, zavmandris other information minotaurs and other ancestries the desire to learn has caused minotaurs to wander far and wide, and as such, they can be encountered far from their original home of iblydos. preferring mountainous or underground regions, minotaurs who put down roots often live with ancestries of a like mind, such as dwarves, hobgoblins, and orcs. the nation of oprak in the inner sea has a small subculture of minotaurs that assist with engineering works across the mindspin mountains. some minotaurs who migrated east from iblydos made it as far as the islands of minata in tian xia, where they were surprised to encounter another bovine ancestry known as sarangay. the first interactions revealed a clear separation between the cultures: sarangay took pride in their origins, while minotaurs strove to move past theirs. whenever a minotaur is mistaken for a sarangay, they politely point out the many differences with a good-natured chuckle. the minotaur prince of absalom nuar spiritskin was born in an enclave of minotaurs within the kortos mounts. smaller in stature than his siblings and with unusually white fur, nuar relocated to the city of absalom after being banished by his kin. in a chance encounter, he rescued the primarch from being assaulted by angry sailors and was then given the honorific title

They are [common](/Traits.aspx?ID=557) in Zi Ha, Po Li, and Goka._\r\n\r\nSamsarans, as the tale goes, originated with a group of scholars in Zi Ha who ventured into the mountains to find the cure for an illness ravaging their village. After weeks of peril, they found a freshwater spring filled with pure magical life essence. This water brought the scholars back from the brink of death and cured the villagers. Given a new chance at life, everyone who drank the water devoted the rest of their life to learning and experiencing the world fully. Upon death, this devotion, combined with the magical essence now infused in their bodies, transformed these people into the first samsarans. \n\nSamsarans dedicate themselves to achieving enlightenment—a true understanding of everything and everyone in the world around and beyond them. Unlike duskwalkers, samsarans reincarnate many times over, with some accumulating thousands of lived lives. This cycle of reincarnation continues until the individual samsaran achieves this goal of enlightenment, or irrevocably fails at making any progress toward it. At that time, a samsaran's soul passes onto the Great Beyond, and their body melts into pure water. For those samsarans who succeeded at enlightenment, they find a time of peace and satisfaction in the afterlife. Those who have failed instead encounter an afterlife filled with misery, punishment, reminders of past failure, or in extreme cases, nothing, leaving the souls to waste away for the rest of time.\n\nWhile samsarans can recall parts of their past incarnations, these recollections often feel like halfremembered dreams. By combining these snippets of memories from the past with new knowledge from their current life span, samsarans can view and connect with the world in entirely unique ways. The detachment that comes with countless lifetimes sometimes makes it difficult for samsarans to empathize and connect with others, however. <br />If you want to play a character who experiences a repeated cycle of existence, seeking out new knowledge and experiences as you walk a path to learning everything you can about the universe, you should play a samsaran.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Samsaran01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Samsaran02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Be single-minded toward a goal to complete the next step of your enlightenment.</li><li>Have a deep sense of curiosity for other people and their perspectives.</li><li>Take things at a slower pace, putting things off until the next cycle of reincarnation.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Think that you're very knowledgeable and wise.</li><li>Assume that you're deeply spiritual and detached from worldly matters.</li><li>Consider you immortal and envy your ability to reincarnate.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nSamsarans reflect the diversity of whatever ancestry they had in their first mortal life cycle, and only upon their first rebirth do they take on the unique features of their kind. The reincarnation cycle gives samsarans blue skin tones, often in a pale shade but ranging to the deepest midnight navy as well. They have pupilless eyes that are typically pallid in coloration, comparable to the moon. Samsarans also have transparent and colorless blood, resembling crystal clear water. \n\nWhen samsarans die, they reincarnate as a baby born to a humanoid couple of non-samsaran ancestry, often in the area a particular samsaran held the most affinity for in their previous life cycle. While they might share some features with their previous incarnation, the similarity is more like the shared appearances between a parent and child rather than identical duplication. Samsarans age at the same rate as humans, and unless they succumb to unnatural causes of death, they die of old age at 100 years old. Children born to samsarans live their first life cycle as the mortal ancestry their parents had and will take on the unique skin color and eyes of other samsarans only after their first death.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nThe ultimate goal for samsarans is to reach enlightenment, but there's no singular path to walk or prescribed way to do so. Rather, each samsaran must explore the universe and learn its many secrets in their own way. Some samsarans find their way into schools, where they study niche research topics for decades at a time. Others act in the service of different gods, each religion offering them guidance to understanding the universe. Many enter periods of long internal reflection, isolating themselves from the outside world, while a handful venture out into the world to experience everything firsthand. From one incarnation to another, a samsaran can also switch up their path, pursuing a new avenue of knowledge and experience than they'd done for the last few centuries. \n\nEven with the independent nature of the path to enlightenment, samsarans don't necessarily go through their journeys alone. Samsarans value community as spaces to share knowledge, find support and safety, and establish a connection with similarly minded people. Samsaran communities are often tightly knit, and their enclaves small. With a focus on knowledge and connection to the world, these samsaran enclaves typically occur in schools and temples. Trusted non-samsarans are invited into these communities to share their expertise and to learn from the collective knowledge of samsarans in different stages of the enlightenment journey. Conflicting perspectives and experiences are welcome, with samsarans encouraged to talk through differences to come to a better combined understanding. \n\nWhen samsarans travel outside of their enclaves, they often live nomadically until they find something they want to study. If their journey takes them to a non-samsaran community, they might spend several cycles learning and experiencing life within that community, lending their knowledge to the people there and becoming a member until the call of enlightenment leads them away. \n\nRarely do samsarans have children, but when they do, the child isn't born a samsaran. Rather, the child bears the ancestry of their parents before they too reincarnated into samsarans, such as a human child born to samsarans who were human in their first life. Thus, it's tradition for children of samsaran lineage who haven't gone through their first rebirth to be adopted by nonsamsaran communities and experience a fully mortal life. This practice isn't done out of cruelty or neglect; most samsarans believe that spending this first lifetime among one's kin is a fundamental element that can never be properly experienced after reincarnation. Some samsarans do choose to raise their children themselves, but they usually keep members of their child's ancestry as close friends to maintain the important connection in this first lifetime. Regardless of their upbringing, once the child dies and reincarnates for the first time, their parents will traditionally bring the child into a samsaran community to begin their path to enlightenment. \n\nWhile a core part of a samsaran's identity is preserved in the reincarnation cycle, their gender, appearance, and perspectives change from incarnation to incarnation. Even with memories shared between life cycles, when a samsaran is reborn, they're treated as a different individual than their previous incarnations.<br />For samsarans, the journey is the destination, so they don't rush through their lifetimes trying to reach enlightenment as quickly as possible. Every incarnation, a samsaran usually focuses on a goal that will further their understanding of the world. However, if the goal isn't accomplished in one lifetime, it gets carried over into the next reincarnation cycle, with some goals lasting several hundred years. The blending of lifetimes combined with the fact that the reincarnation cycle continues indefinitely until enlightenment is achieved—or failed—gives samsarans a skewed sense of time. With as many lifetimes as they could possibly need to accomplish or undo anything they want, urgency isn't a common concept for samsarans.incarnations and their present one.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nWith their lives centered around seeking enlightenment and the laws of the reincarnation cycle, many samsarans tend toward structure and order, tempered by compassion and empathy drawn from existences spent in a variety of bodies. A samsaran's beliefs can also change between incarnations, with the experiences of the previous lifetime impacting their worldviews in the current one. <br />Many samsarans are drawn toward religion and deities, which provide community and a framework to understanding the world that helps guide their path to enlightenment. With each samsaran's path being so independently unique, samsarans might follow any of a wide variety of gods in any given lifetime. However, Tsukiyo is often cited as the patron god of samsarans since many samsarans feel kinship toward his own tale of rebirth and the eternal cycle of the moon. Some tales even suggest that Tsukiyo had blessed the magical springs the first samsarans drank from.\n\n**Popular Edicts** achieve greater self-understanding, find your personal path toward enlightenment, take your time on journeys \n\n**Popular Anathema** live without intention or purpose, prevent others from genuine attempts at learning, stagnate in thought or passion\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nAltuin Nurture, Davare Clarity, Enkhma Defense, Jochi Spellcrafter, Narintya Softheart, Sarange Lawseeker\n<title level=\"2\">Samsaran Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nConstitution, Wisdom, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nCharisma\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Samsaran](/Languages.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

existence, seeking out new knowledge and experiences as you walk a path to learning everything you can about the universe, you should play a samsaran. you might... be single-minded toward a goal to complete the next step of your enlightenment. have a deep sense of curiosity for other people and their perspectives. take things at a slower pace, putting things off until the next cycle of reincarnation. others probably... think that you're very knowledgeable and wise. assume that you're deeply spiritual and detached from worldly matters. consider you immortal and envy your ability to reincarnate. physical description samsarans reflect the diversity of whatever ancestry they had in their first mortal life cycle, and only upon their first rebirth do they take on the unique features of their kind. the reincarnation cycle gives samsarans blue skin tones, often in a pale shade but ranging to the deepest midnight navy as well. they have pupilless eyes that are typically pallid in coloration, comparable to the moon. samsarans also have transparent and colorless blood, resembling crystal clear water. when samsarans die, they reincarnate as a baby born to a humanoid couple of non-samsaran ancestry, often in the area a particular samsaran held the most affinity for in their previous life cycle. while they might share some features with their previous incarnation, the similarity is more like the shared appearances between a parent and child rather than identical duplication. samsarans age at the same rate as humans, and unless they succumb to unnatural causes of death, they die of old age at 100 years old. children born to samsarans live their first life cycle as the mortal ancestry their parents had and will take on the unique skin color and eyes of other samsarans only after their first death. society the ultimate goal for samsarans is to reach enlightenment, but there's no singular path to walk or prescribed way to do so. rather, each samsaran must explore the universe and learn its many secrets in their own way. some samsarans find their way into schools, where they study niche research topics for decades at a time. others act in the service of different gods, each religion offering them guidance to understanding the universe. many enter periods of long internal reflection, isolating themselves from the outside world, while a handful venture out into the world to experience everything firsthand. from one incarnation to another, a samsaran can also switch up their path, pursuing a new avenue of knowledge and experience than they'd done for the last few centuries. even with the independent nature of the path to enlightenment, samsarans don't necessarily go through their journeys alone. samsarans value community as spaces to share knowledge, find support and safety, and establish a connection with similarly minded people. samsaran communities are often tightly knit, and their enclaves small. with a focus on knowledge and connection to the world, these samsaran enclaves typically occur in schools and temples. trusted non-samsarans are invited into these communities to share their expertise and to learn from the collective knowledge of samsarans in different stages of the enlightenment journey. conflicting perspectives and experiences are welcome, with samsarans encouraged to talk through differences to come to a better combined understanding. when samsarans travel outside of their enclaves, they often live nomadically until they find something they want to study. if their journey takes them to a non-samsaran community, they might spend several cycles learning and experiencing life within that community, lending their knowledge to the people there and becoming a member until the call of enlightenment leads them away. rarely do samsarans have children, but when they do, the child isn't born a samsaran. rather, the child bears the ancestry of their parents before they too reincarnated into samsarans, such as a human child born to samsarans who were human in their first life. thus, it's tradition for children of samsaran lineage who haven't gone through their first rebirth to be adopted by nonsamsaran communities and experience a fully mortal life. this practice isn't done out of cruelty or neglect; most samsarans believe that spending this first lifetime among one's kin is a fundamental element that can never be properly experienced after reincarnation. some samsarans do choose to raise their children themselves, but they usually keep members of their child's ancestry as close friends to maintain the important connection in this first lifetime. regardless of their upbringing, once the child dies and reincarnates for the first time, their parents will traditionally bring the child into a samsaran community to begin their path to enlightenment. while a core part of a samsaran's identity is preserved in the reincarnation cycle, their gender, appearance, and perspectives change from incarnation to incarnation. even with memories shared between life cycles, when a samsaran is reborn, they're treated as a different individual than their previous incarnations. for samsarans, the journey is the destination, so they don't rush through their lifetimes trying to reach enlightenment as quickly as possible. every incarnation, a samsaran usually focuses on a goal that will further their understanding of the world. however, if the goal isn't accomplished in one lifetime, it gets carried over into the next reincarnation cycle, with some goals lasting several hundred years. the blending of lifetimes combined with the fact that the reincarnation cycle continues indefinitely until enlightenment is achieved—or failed—gives samsarans a skewed sense of time. with as many lifetimes as they could possibly need to accomplish or undo anything they want, urgency isn't a common concept for samsarans.incarnations and their present one. alignment and religion with their lives centered around seeking enlightenment and the laws of the reincarnation cycle, many samsarans tend toward structure and order, tempered by compassion and empathy drawn from existences spent in a variety of bodies. a samsaran's beliefs can also change between incarnations, with the experiences of the previous lifetime impacting their worldviews in the current one. many samsarans are drawn toward religion and deities, which provide community and a framework to understanding the world that helps guide their path to enlightenment. with each samsaran's path being so independently unique, samsarans might follow any of a wide variety of gods in any given lifetime. however, tsukiyo is often cited as the patron god of samsarans since many samsarans feel kinship toward his own tale of rebirth and the eternal cycle of the moon. some tales even suggest that tsukiyo had blessed the magical springs the first samsarans drank from. popular edicts achieve greater

Known for the magical gems in their foreheads that are said to contain their souls._\r\n\r\nSarangay are carabao-headed people who have long survived deep in the forests across Tian Xia. Many adventurers have thought them to be monsters at first, but sarangay are nothing more than a thriving society who value their community and their souls above all else. Their cultures are built upon the intense desire to protect their communities and their chosen leader. Their horns are said to be a crescent moon, and their towering statures are said to have come from their ancestors being stretched so far up to reach their Father Moon while their Mother Earth kept them close to her bosom. They revere the great Father Moon, their First Ancestor, and endeavor to protect and exalt nature above all else, for they understand that they're part of it. \n\nSarangay tend to be rare and appear even rarer within the diverse confines of adventuring cities. When they leave their society, it's typically because they either have a duty to fulfill or they must depart in order to save their community. In the rising chaos of the modern lands of Tian Xia, more sarangay have begun to venture out into the world, either preemptively investigating potential threats or facing a breakdown in their own societies. The most tragic sarangay are those who wander alone because they have nothing and no one to protect and care for. \n\nIf you want to play a character who is at home in the wild, possesses inherent occult power, is sharply aware of their impressive strength, and comes from a proud culture, you should play a sarangay.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Sarangay01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Sarangay02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Show off your head gem to loved ones but hide it from those that you don't trust.</li><li>Exalt a warrior culture that focuses on protecting what's yours as well as the forests and lands around your settlements.</li><li>Be overly protective of those you care about, even to violent ends.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Are circumspect about the topic of your head gem,either out of empathetic respect or scheming greed.</li><li>Trust your word when you say you would protect the ones you love.</li><li>Underestimate just how gentle you can be when it comes to those you care for.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nSarangay are tall warriors with humanoid bodies that almost always have naturally heavy builds. They average at about 6 to 7 feet tall and have visibly muscular physiques—sarangay very often describe humans and similarly built ancestries as “slender” due to the difference between their typical figures. Their eyes are black orbs with white crescents for pupils. They have large, clawed hands, while their legs end in hooves that have the capacity to topple trees. Sarangay reach adulthood when their horns reach 2 feet in length. Their jewelry tends to include large horn platings, nose rings, and excessively large bangles made of gold common in the forests where sarangay live. \n\nFrom birth, every sarangay has a giant gleaming stone upon their brow known as their head gem, which houses their soul. When sarangay choose a partner, they switch their head gems with each other and are in love for the rest of their lives. Unsurprisingly, sarangay are belligerent against anyone who would steal these gems. Unfortunately, the size, quality, and rarity of the head gems give them a staggering market value, and their spiritual associations attract unscrupulous magicians.Callous nobles of Tian Xia love to carve such gems into decorations or display the gems upon their desks and in their lavish living areas.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nSarangay are strong individually, but together, they're considered unbeatable. Most sarangay communities are small villages deep within the forests, but they demonstrate the same amount of diversity as the other ancestries of Tian Xia. These settlements are built out of houses that can be easily destroyed and remade; these residences can be moved with the shifting seasons and tides, to avoid invaders and other threats, and to uphold the proper geomancy of a village. The center of a village is always the house of the village chief, usually known as the datu, or sometimes ratu. The datu's house is known as the kraton, a large multi-storied palace made of the best hardwood, lacquered and oiled, making it less disposable than the other houses. \n\nThe datu is surrounded in their daily lives by their closest companions, usually either their own kin or a coterie of vassals who are indebted to the datu and are obliged to fight as the datu's own warband of faithful knights. Those sarangay related to the datu are often known as nobles, and they can take on any profession of their liking. The rest of the village is made up of commoners who do a large amount of the work for the village. They render a part of their labor to the datu in return for the protection and prestige of the datu's stewardship. This hierarchy isn't mandated by some divinity, but rather out of respect for a worthy leader. Datu who are deemed unworthy by the rest of the village are often overthrown by the concerted efforts of the commoners, who then choose a better datu, who can even come from their own ranks.\n\nSarangay hold their gleaming head gems in the highest regard, for the gems are said to contain their souls and all their memories. If a sarangay's gem is destroyed, it can regrow through the help of a shaman's ritual, but the gem-less sarangay falls into a state of dreamless stupor until then. Entire warbands are formed in villages to protect against poachers and adventurers who would steal head gems to achieve untold riches.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nDespite their inherent occult powers, sarangay are very attuned to the forces of nature and the rhythms of wild places. They particularly hold the moon, which they call Ama Vulan—Father Moon—in the highest regard. Sarangay believe their horns represent the moon in its crescent phase, and their head gem is the moon at its fullest. During the full moon, sarangay perform intricate rituals to earn merit and favor from Father Moon, whom they believe to be their First Ancestor. Other than Father Moon and Mother Earth, they pay proper reverence to the thousand little gods who live in the leaves, in the droplets of water, in the embers of a bonfire. Sarangay believe that nature is inherently divine and alive, living much like they do.\n\n**Popular Edicts** protect what's yours, seek to understand the duality of the earth and moon, spend time enjoying the rhythms of nature \n\n**Popular Anathema** betray a worthy leader, remove your head gem without good cause\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nDakal, Davvun, Karatallu, Kasta, Kunnasi, Makkan Vulan, Mangi Yavu, Mappia, Nallutu, Ngatta, Nikanni, Sikamu, Tadday, Tullung, Uzzin, Vulu Vvuga\n<title level=\"2\">Sarangay Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nStrength, Charisma, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nWisdom\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

these residences can be moved with the shifting seasons and tides, to avoid invaders and other threats, and to uphold the proper geomancy of a village. the center of a village is always the house of the village chief, usually known as the datu, or sometimes ratu. the datu's house is known as the kraton, a large multi-storied palace made of the best hardwood, lacquered and oiled, making it less disposable than the other houses. the datu is surrounded in their daily lives by their closest companions, usually either their own kin or a coterie of vassals who are indebted to the datu and are obliged to fight as the datu's own warband of faithful knights. those sarangay related to the datu are often known as nobles, and they can take on any profession of their liking. the rest of the village is made up of commoners who do a large amount of the work for the village. they render a part of their labor to the datu in return for the protection and prestige of the datu's stewardship. this hierarchy isn't mandated by some divinity, but rather out of respect for a worthy leader. datu who are deemed unworthy by the rest of the village are often overthrown by the concerted efforts of the commoners, who then choose a better datu, who can even come from their own ranks. sarangay hold their gleaming head gems in the highest regard, for the gems are said to contain their souls and all their memories. if a sarangay's gem is destroyed, it can regrow through the help of a shaman's ritual, but the gem-less sarangay falls into a state of dreamless stupor until then. entire warbands are formed in villages to protect against poachers and adventurers who would steal head gems to achieve untold riches. alignment and religion despite their inherent occult powers, sarangay are very attuned to the forces of nature and the rhythms of wild places. they particularly hold the moon, which they call ama vulan—father moon—in the highest regard. sarangay believe their horns represent the moon in its crescent phase, and their head gem is the moon at its fullest. during the full moon, sarangay perform intricate rituals to earn merit and favor from father moon, whom they believe to be their first ancestor. other than father moon and mother earth, they pay proper reverence to the thousand little gods who live in the leaves, in the droplets of water, in the embers of a bonfire. sarangay believe that nature is inherently divine and alive, living much like they do. popular edicts protect what's yours, seek to understand the duality of the earth and moon, spend time enjoying the rhythms of nature popular anathema betray a worthy leader, remove your head gem without good cause names dakal, davvun, karatallu, kasta, kunnasi, makkan vulan, mangi yavu, mappia, nallutu, ngatta, nikanni, sikamu, tadday, tullung, uzzin, vulu vvuga sarangay mechanics hit points 8 size medium speed 25 feet attribute boosts strength, charisma, free attribute flaws wisdom languages common additional languages equal to your intelligence modifier (if it's positive). choose from empyreal, fey, nagaji, petran, pyric, sussuran, thalassic, yaksha, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region). horns your powerful horns are formidable weapons. you have a horns unarmed attack that deals 1d6 piercing damage and has the shove trait. your horns are in the brawling group. head gem upon your brow is a gem that houses your soul. when casting any spell or ritual to return you to life, your intact head gem can be substituted for your body. while you can freely remove your head gem, it's typically impossible for another creature to forcibly remove or destroy your head gem unless you're killed or permanently incapacitated first;

As a subterranean species native to the Darklands, surkis have rarely been seen on the surface, and always with long pauses between historical sightings.

The healing of the Worldwound initiated one of the largest such digs in their history, bringing surkis up into the caverns and passages of the Sarkoris Scar and emerging onto the surface for the first time in many years.

This magic is refined and sequestered in nodes throughout a surki's body over the course of their life cycle, which is comprised of three distinct phases: larva, adult, and evolved. At each stage, surkis use their stockpiled magic to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis into their next stage of life, evolving adaptations that will help them survive in any environment. Surkis therefore vary dramatically on an individual level; each surki tells the story of their adventures and their chosen role in the environment in their unique combination of adaptations.\n\n If you want to play a character who's exploring Golarion for the first time, with limitless adaptability and a strong tie to magic, you should play a surki.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Surki01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Surki02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Feel a very strong connection to the world around you, sensing the latent magic in everything.</li><li>Be driven to travel far or learn as much as you can about your home.</li><li>Pay particular attention to the way others live in environments unfamiliar to you.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Mistake your individuality and excitement for your adaptations as boastful pride.</li><li>Find your excitement for new people, places, and things endearing and inspirational.</li><li>Trust your magical senses over their own maps in tight situations.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nEach of surkis' three life stages greatly differ. Larval surkis spend the first 10 to 100 years of their lives dormant inside their eggs, waiting to emerge when they've accumulated enough latent magic and the environmental conditions are just right. Larval surkis are roughly two feet long and grub-like with several luminescent nodes visible through their translucent flesh. Their heads are chitinous, round, and eyeless, and they navigate primarily using the ability to smell magic. Four of their six legs are small, but the front set are large, powerful digging claws that they use to tunnel through the earth and to communicate with the other larvae in their generation dig as they travel from their nest home. Once they've traveled far and accumulated enough magic, they enter a cocoon for several days, emerging as the adult form that's seen most often on the surface.\n\n Adult surkis have a roughly bipedal form, standing on two multi-jointed limbs and having two arms that end in three-fingered claws used both for digging and for producing percussive sounds used in the Surki language. They possess two feathery antennae and two long sensory barbels that sit on either side of their mandibles. Surkis have a characteristic rounded shape with several rust-brown or orange chitinous plates along their back, and surki clothing and fashion tend to incorporate rounded shapes or belts around and under their plates. Their magical nodes are distributed throughout their bodies, clustering in the abdomen, shoulders, and each limb. These nodes continue to accumulate magic as they age, using it to create new adaptations, often heralded by intricate, luminescent patterns in the chitin surrounding the point of change.\n\n The final stage in surkis' life cycle is known as the evolved form, after the surki enters its grand metamorphosis. An adult surki forms a chrysalis and rapidly changes over the course of a single evening. Less physically dramatic than the shift between larva and adulthood, the evolved form brings with it profound magical abilities that resulted from a lifetime of magical absorption and refinement. Evolved surkis' nodes metamorphose into complex organs capable of projecting tangible magic to a variety of ends, from digging apparatuses made out of pure force to glowing wings that defy gravity. This final form is the ultimate expression of any surki's individuality and adaptations—a form perfectly suited to fulfill the environment they choose to inhabit or the role they wish to fill.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nSurki society places great importance on individuality and self-expression. Every surki is expected to find their own way of doing things, and innovation is a highly prized achievement. Surkis are also very much in touch with their environment; they place no distinction between plant and animal, recognizing that every being fills an important part of the environment. This quality has led surkis to create settlements that leave as little impact on the environment as possible, weaving silks around plants and fungi to coax them to grow into shelters and walls. Wood and other plant-based resources are seldom harvested in a manner considered traditional to most societies in Golarion. These resources are portioned out in strategically grown sections and harvested precisely enough to not kill the plant if possible.\n\n Surki relationships are focused on complementing adaptations. Surkis are generally polyamorous and might maintain a close bond with numerous others. Surkis are a single-sex species, and while they understand concepts of gender and orientation as experienced by other ancestries, many surkis find the idea of choosing not to bond with someone based on anatomy or personal descriptions absurd. They instead choose to pursue those with personalities, talents, or adaptations that augment their own in unexpected ways, such as using woven silks to reinforce a tunnel dug through loose rock. Nevertheless, attraction in surki society is as complicated an idea as in any other, and bonded surkis will often express their feelings toward a loved one with a personal description that expresses something they value within the relationship. For example, a surki might introduce a partner as “Who Speaks Quietly and Makes My Soil Richer.”\n\n Only adult surkis are capable of reproducing, which they do through parthenogenesis. Any adult surki can lay an egg when they choose, though because the process expends so much of the magic stored in their nodes, few surkis lay more than one egg every few years. Many of these eggs are kept in a protected area of the settlement, awaiting the next generation dig. When the eggs are ready, they hatch en masse, and the larva coordinate their departure, drawn to magic like a beacon tunneling through the earth and stone to find a new place to settle.\n\n Familial life vastly differs for surkis. Eggs lain outside of a generation dig are cared for and tended by the surki “parent” until the grub emerges. New village grubs are typically left to their own devices, allowed to venture outside the village or even leave the community altogether. Often, village grubs find their first homes in the soil of the community farms, where they feed on the natural magic within the soil and plant life. These gardens double as schools for these grubs, as the adult and evolved surkis who tend the gardens regularly converse with the grubs, thumping and scraping out the stories of their young lives and the lessons they've learned from others. Surki grubs born early or those whose nodes don't function well are often bonded with ostillis, small amorphous symbiotes that augment the grubs' ability to absorb nutrients from magic.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nSurkis' connection to their environment leads them to typically worship natural deities. Their own ancient traditions identify each creature as possessing a unique spirit, with keystone species occupying a deific role within their ecosystem. Surki traditions dictate that surkis and other cultures aren't part of this spirit cycle, though with time, care, and practice, one can be accepted into it with the blessing of the environment's keystone species.\n\n Among surki communities in Sarkoris, worship of [Gozreh](/Deities.aspx?ID=284) and [Sturovenen](/Deities.aspx?ID=173) has grown quickly. Surkis who dedicate themselves to a deity are more likely to choose one representing their own environment or the natural world as a whole. Deities whose domains include [travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93) or [change](/Domains.aspx?ID=40) are also popular among surki devotees.\n\n It's very important to surkis that life be allowed to follow its natural course. Death, violence, and war all have their place and purpose.\n\n **Popular Edicts** encourage others to discover their true selves, protect and nurture natural ecosystems, work with others to promote symbiotic relationships<br /> **Popular Anathema** force another to change before they're ready\n\n<title level=\"2\">Adventurers</title>\r\nSurkis are born explorers. Their innate curiosity for the world and interest in all things new, strange, and magical compel many to venture into the wild corners of Golarion. Their connection to their environment leads many to become [druids](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) and [rangers](/Classes.aspx?ID=9), while their adaptability and knack for survival can make them imposing [champions](/Classes.aspx?ID=4). Surkis who leave their colonies often sign on as sailors or caravan guards, though it's rare to find any surki filling a position outside of their own colony\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nSurkis choose their names when they enter adolescence. Every surki has a name referred to as their “root” or “grub” name that's produced solely with the forelimbs. Adults commonly incorporate all or part of their root name preceding their chosen name, though it isn't expected to be repeated, especially by those of other ancestries who don't possess the exoskeleton necessary to “pronounce” the name. The root name, while shown proudly, is considered the personal property of the surki who possesses it, and repetition of the root portion of a surki's name is considered rude by most, tantamount to theft. Surkis' chosen names typically represent a personal quality that they admire most or an achievement they take pride in. As surkis age, they might change their chosen name to better fit who they feel they've become. When surkis die, any present-tense verbs used in their names become past tense.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Sample Names</title>\r\nBearer of Heavy Boulders, Weaver of Intricate Webs, With the Deftest Song, Who Shines Brightly, Whose Patterns are Bold, Whose Voice is Music\n<title level=\"2\">Surki Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nConstitution, Free\n\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Surki](/Languages.aspx?ID=176)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Their connection to their environment leads many to become druids and rangers, while their adaptability and knack for survival can make them imposing champions. Surkis who leave their colonies often sign on as sailors or caravan guards, though it's rare to find any surki filling a position outside of their own colony Names Surkis choose their names when they enter adolescence. Every surki has a name referred to as their “root” or “grub” name that's produced solely with the forelimbs. Adults commonly incorporate all or part of their root name preceding their chosen name, though it isn't expected to be repeated, especially by those of other ancestries who don't possess the exoskeleton necessary to “pronounce” the name. The root name, while shown proudly, is considered the personal property of the surki who possesses it, and repetition of the root portion of a surki's name is considered rude by most, tantamount to theft. Surkis' chosen names typically represent a personal quality that they admire most or an achievement they take pride in. As surkis age, they might change their chosen name to better fit who they feel they've become. When surkis die, any present-tense verbs used in their names become past tense.

excitement for new people, places, and things endearing and inspirational. trust your magical senses over their own maps in tight situations. physical description each of surkis' three life stages greatly differ. larval surkis spend the first 10 to 100 years of their lives dormant inside their eggs, waiting to emerge when they've accumulated enough latent magic and the environmental conditions are just right. larval surkis are roughly two feet long and grub-like with several luminescent nodes visible through their translucent flesh. their heads are chitinous, round, and eyeless, and they navigate primarily using the ability to smell magic. four of their six legs are small, but the front set are large, powerful digging claws that they use to tunnel through the earth and to communicate with the other larvae in their generation dig as they travel from their nest home. once they've traveled far and accumulated enough magic, they enter a cocoon for several days, emerging as the adult form that's seen most often on the surface. adult surkis have a roughly bipedal form, standing on two multi-jointed limbs and having two arms that end in three-fingered claws used both for digging and for producing percussive sounds used in the surki language. they possess two feathery antennae and two long sensory barbels that sit on either side of their mandibles. surkis have a characteristic rounded shape with several rust-brown or orange chitinous plates along their back, and surki clothing and fashion tend to incorporate rounded shapes or belts around and under their plates. their magical nodes are distributed throughout their bodies, clustering in the abdomen, shoulders, and each limb. these nodes continue to accumulate magic as they age, using it to create new adaptations, often heralded by intricate, luminescent patterns in the chitin surrounding the point of change. the final stage in surkis' life cycle is known as the evolved form, after the surki enters its grand metamorphosis. an adult surki forms a chrysalis and rapidly changes over the course of a single evening. less physically dramatic than the shift between larva and adulthood, the evolved form brings with it profound magical abilities that resulted from a lifetime of magical absorption and refinement. evolved surkis' nodes metamorphose into complex organs capable of projecting tangible magic to a variety of ends, from digging apparatuses made out of pure force to glowing wings that defy gravity. this final form is the ultimate expression of any surki's individuality and adaptations—a form perfectly suited to fulfill the environment they choose to inhabit or the role they wish to fill. society surki society places great importance on individuality and self-expression. every surki is expected to find their own way of doing things, and innovation is a highly prized achievement. surkis are also very much in touch with their environment; they place no distinction between plant and animal, recognizing that every being fills an important part of the environment. this quality has led surkis to create settlements that leave as little impact on the environment as possible, weaving silks around plants and fungi to coax them to grow into shelters and walls. wood and other plant-based resources are seldom harvested in a manner considered traditional to most societies in golarion. these resources are portioned out in strategically grown sections and harvested precisely enough to not kill the plant if possible. surki relationships are focused on complementing adaptations. surkis are generally polyamorous and might maintain a close bond with numerous others. surkis are a single-sex species, and while they understand concepts of gender and orientation as experienced by other ancestries, many surkis find the idea of choosing not to bond with someone based on anatomy or personal descriptions absurd. they instead choose to pursue those with personalities, talents, or adaptations that augment their own in unexpected ways, such as using woven silks to reinforce a tunnel dug through loose rock. nevertheless, attraction in surki society is as complicated an idea as in any other, and bonded surkis will often express their feelings toward a loved one with a personal description that expresses something they value within the relationship. for example, a surki might introduce a partner as “who speaks quietly and makes my soil richer.” only adult surkis are capable of reproducing, which they do through parthenogenesis. any adult surki can lay an egg when they choose, though because the process expends so much of the magic stored in their nodes, few surkis lay more than one egg every few years. many of these eggs are kept in a protected area of the settlement, awaiting the next generation dig. when the eggs are ready, they hatch en masse, and the larva coordinate their departure, drawn to magic like a beacon tunneling through the earth and stone to find a new place to settle. familial life vastly differs for surkis. eggs lain outside of a generation dig are cared for and tended by the surki “parent” until the grub emerges. new village grubs are typically left to their own devices, allowed to venture outside the village or even leave the community altogether. often, village grubs find their first homes in the soil of the community farms, where they feed on the natural magic within the soil and plant life. these gardens double as schools for these grubs, as the adult and evolved surkis who tend the gardens regularly converse with the grubs, thumping and scraping out the stories of their young lives and the lessons they've learned from others. surki grubs born early or those whose nodes don't function well are often bonded with ostillis, small amorphous symbiotes that augment the grubs' ability to absorb nutrients from magic. alignment and religion surkis' connection to their environment leads them to typically worship natural deities. their own ancient traditions identify each creature as possessing a unique spirit, with keystone species occupying a deific role within their ecosystem. surki traditions dictate that surkis and other cultures aren't part of this spirit cycle, though with time, care, and practice, one can be accepted into it with the blessing of the environment's keystone species. among surki communities in sarkoris, worship of gozreh and sturovenen has grown quickly. surkis who dedicate themselves to a deity are more likely to choose one representing their own environment or the natural world as a whole. deities whose domains include travel or change are also popular among surki devotees. it's very important to surkis that life be allowed to follow its natural course. death, violence, and war all have their place and purpose. popular edicts encourage others to discover their true selves, protect and nurture natural ecosystems, work with others to promote symbiotic relationships popular anathema force another to change before they're ready adventurers surkis are born explorers. their innate curiosity for the world and interest in all things new, strange, and

Gildedsoul taloses may be distantly descended from a sky dragon, lending scaled patterns to their skin and fangs to their mouths. On the other hand, a quicksoul talos may not be descended from any elemental at all, and instead result from their parent's extended exposure to metal-based alchemical fumes during pregnancy. Talos Heritage Mechanics Your physical features reflect the influence a zuhra or other metal elemental has had over your bloodline. Your skin likely has a metallic sheen, ranging from the dull luster of raw ore to the gleaming polish of a new blade, with the wear of age or hardship taking the form of tarnish, rust, or scouring. Your hair might resemble spun gold, coiled steel, copper wiring, or braided chains. You gain the talos trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain resistance to electricity equal to half your level (minimum 1). You can cast the detect metal cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. You can choose from talos feats, geniekin feats, and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.","trait":["Talos","Uncommon"],"trait_group":["Ancestry","Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Talos](/Traits.aspx?ID=507), [Uncommon](/Traits.aspx?ID=159)","trait_raw":["Talos","Uncommon"],"type":"Versatile Heritage","url":"/Ancestries.aspx?ID=58","weakness":{},"description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Versatile Heritage\" pfs=\"\">[Talos](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=58)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=159\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Talos\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=507\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Rage of Elements](/Sources.aspx?ID=205) pg. 50 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n_Taloses, geniekin gifted with magic from the [Plane of Metal](/Planes.aspx?ID=24), resonate with the unlimited potential of raw ore, the treasured shine of polished gold, or the forgiving ring of a hammer reforging a broken blade._\r\n\r\nAs the [Plane of Metal](/Planes.aspx?ID=24) renews its contact with other planes, its influence over the bloodlines of those descended from its elemental denizens results in an ever-increasing number of the planar scions known as taloses.

even the blue-green of abysium and other skymetal colors make rare but not unheard-of appearances. hair covers the same range of color and an even wider variety of metallic textures, from tight, sharp coils of steel wool to strands of gold as thin as spun thread, or even delicate chains of silver or iron. hair length and style are equally varied. taloses bear a passing resemblance to other ancestries and heritages with bodies partially made of metal, which may lead to confusion early in life before their elemental metal affinity becomes clear. as they are born, not built, taloses bear none of the telltale seams or circuits of androids and other construct. taloses also lack the uncanny mathematical balance of aphorites; their bodies may bear the rough texture of beaten silver, the iridescent swirls of numerian steel, or the scuffs, rust, and tarnish left by a long or hard life. as for their oread cousins, the greatest physical indicator of a talos in comparison is a distinct lack of nonmetallic, earthy features; most oreads will have at least a bit of cragginess around the edges that a talos lacks. society a talos is most often born and raised amid the society of their mortal family. the general lack of widespread knowledge about the plane of metal can result in the sense of isolation common to geniekin, which might be especially pronounced for a young talos. talos children tend to be quick-witted and mercurial, prone to flamboyant displays of their natural talents and hard-won skills in an ongoing quest for attention. those taloses who don't go into fields utilizing alchemy, smithing, or other forms of metalwork often become performers or diplomats to put their natural charisma and (sometimes literally) magnetic personalities to work. alignment and religion taloses are often regarded as independent and inconstant, with detractors writing them off as “all flash, no substance.” they sometimes have difficulty connecting with other people but are rarely actively malicious; even those who lack confidence tend to be good at faking it well enough to get by. the most popular deities among religious-minded taloses are gods of metals and crafts: torag in particular, but also the likes of daikitsu and grandmother spider. some taloses feel a kinship with the metal goddesses brigh and casandalee, while others object to being conflated with constructs. those hailing from the plane of metal often revere laudinmio &lt;%end> and ferrumnestra &lt;%end>, the elemental lords of metal;

They tend to have rotund bodies, with large bellies that appear even wider due to their thick fur. A tanuki's face is likewise round, with wide-set, alert eyes outlined within a dark mask of fur. Tanuki have a single bushy tail that they take great pride in and to which they ascribe their powers. These qualities together give tanuki a strong cultural appreciation for rounded shapes over sharp angles, such as daruma dolls, circular doors, and the moon. \n\nTanuki often wear simple, rustic clothing, opting for plain garb over elegant frills or shining jewels. However, tanuki are known to go all-out for festivals and similar celebrations, which they see as the perfect opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest. Many tanuki make it a point to always carry a red vest and dancing towel in case an impromptu party breaks out.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nTanuki know that, among the many people of Golarion, they're underdogs, possessing neither the mastery of the heavens that tengu command nor the divine favor that kitsune enjoy. All things considered, tanuki know they have to support each other, building tight communities where everyone knows each other's names. These communities tend to exist on the outskirts of villages, often in abandoned warehouses or farms or else near temples and other public buildings. When tanuki societies overlap with those of other peoples, they usually function unseen with their own codes of honor, rarely noticed by those in power.\n\nTanuki love celebration and will hold any number of parties for even the smallest accomplishments—a project such as building a new bridge might have a kick-off ceremony, a toast when the plans are decided, a morale lunch when the workers have assembled, a banquet upon finishing the bridge, and a festival to dance over the bridge when it opens to the public. This proclivity is sometimes brought up as a reason for why tanuki endeavors tend to take an interminably long time (with some failing spectacularly along the way), but tanuki feel that it's important to celebrate what small victories they can. Besides, the community bonds forged among the participants are as much a part of the project as the actual building itself.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nTanuki count no member of the Celestial Court among their own—a fact they see as further evidence that they have to stick up for each other since there's no tanuki deity looking out for them—but they find themselves drawn toward gods such as Kofusachi, whose boisterous and compassionate approach to life they consider aspirational. Though tanuki hold deep reverence toward the moon, they tend not to worship [Tsukiyo](/Deities.aspx?ID=317), knowing he finds loud worship agitating, and they take care to not invoke his name or imagery during harvest moon or lunar new year celebrations to ensure their cheers and belly drums don't draw his attention. Tanuki with Inner Sea cultural traditions tend to revere [Cayden Cailean](/Deities.aspx?ID=280), seeing the blood of a tanuki in his commoner status (and drunken accomplishments), with some tanuki statues even depicting Cayden with a big belly and leaf atop his head to suggest that he was simply a tanuki in human form, tricking the Avistani even to this day. \n\nTanuki generally use their powers to humble the rich and snobby; at the very least, they create illusions with no more evil in their hearts than a simple joke (or a free meal taken from one who can afford it), rather than acting out of malice. However, there are some tanuki do harbor resentment, which can take root and fester in their hearts.

at the very least, they create illusions with no more evil in their hearts than a simple joke (or a free meal taken from one who can afford it), rather than acting out of malice. however, there are some tanuki do harbor resentment, which can take root and fester in their hearts. these tanuki turn to cruel ends, known for all manner of nefarious deeds, chief among them cooking their enemies into soups or stews once they've finished tricking them. popular edicts choose excitement over stability, let bygones be bygones, make your community laugh popular anathema feel entitled to social status, prank one of lower means than yourself, wallow in your failures names ame, chiyo, chosuke, hinata, mari, nao, saya, taro, terao, rei, ichiro, jiro, saburo, shiro, satsuki, mutsu, nanami, hazuki tanuki mechanics hit points 10 size small speed 25 feet attribute boosts constitution, charisma, free attribute flaws wisdom languages common tanuki additional languages equal to your intelligence modifier (if it's positive). choose from elven, fey, gnomish, goblin, kitsune, tengu, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region). change shape single action (concentrate, polymorph, primal, tanuki) you can transform into a mundane raccoon dog, using the statistics of pest form . this is a specific raccoon dog form that's the same age and body type as your true form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. using change shape counts as creating a disguise for the impersonate use of deception. you lose any unarmed strikes you gained from a tanuki heritage or ancestry feat in this form. you can remain in your raccoon dog form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your tanuki form by using this action again."},{"attribute":["Dexterity","Free"],"category":"ancestry","exclude_from_search":false,"hp":6,"hp_raw":"6","id":"ancestry-83","image":["/Images/Ancestries/Tengu01.webp","/Images/Ancestries/Tengu02.webp"],"language":["Common","Tengu"],"language_markdown":"[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155), [Tengu](/Languages.aspx?ID=47)","legacy_id":["ancestry-21"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Ancestry\" pfs=\"\">[Tengu](/Ancestries.aspx?ID=83)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n<trait label=\"Uncommon\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=721\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Humanoid\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=628\" />\r\n<trait label=\"Tengu\" url=\"/Traits.aspx?ID=776\" />\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 32 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_Tengus are gregarious and resourceful avian humanoids who collect knowledge and treasures alike._\r\n\r\nTengu are survivalists and conversationalists, equally at home living off the wilderness and finding a niche in dense cities.

others. Despite their cautious outlook and small stature, adventurous tripkees still take bold and noble action when the situation demands it.\n\n Tripkees are reclusive treetop survivalists who harvest their homes' bounty, utilizing their canopy homes as natural fortifications against the threats posed by larger predators. Their reliance on cunning and simple tools has led to tripkees often being mischaracterized as rudimentary, though this does poor justice to their skill in the cultivation of hidden orchards and camouflaged causeways tucked away in treetop nations. Tripkees are most likely to emerge from their forest homes to trade, explore, and combat threats that would despoil the world.\n\n If you want a character who is small in stature but large in spirit, and possesses qualities of a tree frog, you should play a tripkee.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Tripkee01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Tripkee02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Seek out clever ways to exploit your environment when overcoming challenges.</li><li>Make friends slowly, concerned by cautionary tales of exploitative strangers.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Trust in your impartial, measured approach to understanding situations and solving problems.</li><li>Give you space, fearing that touching you would prove toxic.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nTripkees resemble humanoid tree frogs, with oversized eyes, wide mouths, and gangly physiques. Their slight frames and large toes can afford excellent grip while climbing, while their colorful skin provides reliable camouflage that varies by their home environment—green and brown for jungle-dwelling groups, blue and orange for riparian communities, and many other colors between. A tripkee grows quickly, reaching their adult size of approximately 2 feet in height about 3 years after hatching, though they're only considered adults around age 12. Tripkees rarely live beyond 60 years, though exceptional individuals occasionally live as long as a century.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nTripkees lead a sophisticated hunter-gatherer lifestyle within which they reshape the landscape to suit their needs: building spillways to trap fish, seeding fruit-bearing trees, sowing cover-granting foliage for future hunts, and more techniques that often escape an agriculturist's eye. These strategies rely on community cooperation as well as dispersed populations, so tripkees commonly live in small villages, each part of a complex web of alliances and relationships.

Immigrated to Golarion after Earthfall._\r\n\r\nWayangs are diasporic sojourners from the Netherworld where they lived and worked alongside their allies, lightweaving d'ziriaks. Both peoples shared affinities for artistic expression and spiritual introspection, inspiring each other's sensitivities to color, form, and function; they also bolstered each other's defense against rampaging dragons, oni, and undead. This idyll collapsed from divine meddling; some say when Abadar sentenced [Zon-Kuthon](/Deities.aspx?ID=296) to exile in the Netherworld, the Midnight Lord's deific presence distorted the plane into a nightmarish domain, while others accounts ascribe fiendish sources to this doom. \n\nWhatever the reason, wayang and d'ziriak communities suffered terribly; Kuthites and velstracs colonized the Netherworld, engulfing it in religious wars of slaughter and brutality—an ongoing catastrophe that wayangs and d'ziriaks refer to as the Desecration. Despite both peoples' valorous resistance, with every generation, space and resources became scarcer. When the Age of Ashes created passageways between the Netherworld and Golarion, many wayangs sailed away for a better life. \n\nThese curious wayfarers became Tian Xia's first wayangs, who shared their skills and labor to eke out a solidarity of subsistence with Earthfall's survivors. These explorers also observed how Tian Xia's suffering souls weakened barriers to the Netherworld, whose malignant overlords absorbed the negative emotions to grow in power. While disappointments, melancholia, and other negative experiences were part and parcel of existence, the engineers of the Desecration exploited mortal emotions to oppress both the Universe and its shadow Netherworlds.\n\nRealizing these planar interconnections, wayang leaders reached a bold conclusion: no world is free until all worlds are. To prevent the Netherworlds' colonial oppressors from harnessing mortal souls and to reclaim the darkness from its present state of malice and anguish, more wayang expeditions arrived in Tian Xia with exorcists and cursebreakers to purify paths to the Netherworld and starve its despots of spiritual power. Toward this end, wayang sages devised the Dissolution, a philosophy of drawing strength and peace from one's inner darkness. They shared their teachings discreetly with those in Tian Xia touched by darkness, instead of leaving such people to be preyed upon by velstracs and other depraved entities. \n\nIf you want to play a character who is at home in the shadows of Tian Xia's oceans and jungles, is heir to mystic and martial arts drawing upon the Netherworld's untainted power, and pursues obscure struggles against dark forces, you should play a wayang.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Wayang01.webp\" />\r\n<image src=\"/images/Ancestries/Wayang02.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Seek out Tian Xia's dark places, such as mountainous caves, shaded mangroves, or rainforest canopies.</li><li>Be curious about this sunlit world, so different from your home's occluded vistas, and seek out new experiences to inspire your artistic expressions and meditative introspection.</li><li>Dream and work toward a time when your people can overthrow your invasive masters.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Consider you creative and seek to commission you as an artisan or appraiser.</li><li>Fail to understand your people's motives and distant struggles.</li><li>Whisper frightful rumors about your origins and attribute curses to your presence.</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Physical Description</title>\r\nThe rigors of an interplanar struggle and life on or near the seas of Tian Xia grant many wayangs wiry frames, and many carry themselves with a gravitas that belies their small stature. Despite long journeys under cloudless skies, wayangs' skin (ranging from ivory white to duskwood black) doesn't sunburn easily, a blessing attributed to the darkness's love for its children. Thick shadows flit and dance almost like a second layer of skin upon wayang bodies, sheltering them from the sun's glare. Wayangs further decorate their skin with intricate patterns of paint, which non-wayangs often misinterpret as scarification or tattoos. With concentration and training, wayangs can move their shadows independently of their body, an ability that both warriors and storytellers use to great effect, either in aiding their ambushes or illustrating their performances. Wayangs tend to grow their hair long, construct elaborate headdresses of shell and horn to hold their hair up in immaculate hairstyles, and favor long scarves or shawls over their shoulders.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nWayang society encompasses many tensions between communal and individualistic behaviors. While wayangs organize themselves into collectives modeled after agrarian villages or seafaring crews where everyone has to do their part for the shared betterment, hermits and iconoclasts are also afforded special places in wayang society. While individual wayang villages or ships might look to their leaders for direction in everyday matters, these leaders in turn also look to solitary gurus and unconventional visionaries for guidance and inspiration.<br /> <br />The wayang political universe is composed of multiple overlapping mandalas, concentrations of influence around central charismatic and powerful figures, such as experienced chieftains, ingenious artisans, or intrepid captains. In turn, these individual concentrations cohere around yet other figures famed for righteousness or wisdom, such as sagacious teachers, virtuous princes, or masterful occultists. This approach to social power is useful for organizing diverse diasporas scattered across islands and planes; each collective practices sufficient independence to pursue their own journeys while retaining enough interdependence to respond to others' calls for help and friendship. \n\nWayang interactions with other communities usually take place as visiting artisans bearing handcrafted goods of precious materials and exquisite quality. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these items also provide potent supernatural protection against fiends and undead. Despite the high demand, wayangs don't sell them, but instead offer them freely only to those blessed by shadows, such as particular sorcerer bloodlines. Wayang emissaries use these gifts to aid potential allies and strengthen them against other forces of darkness. In time, many also hope to instruct their newfound friends in the secrets of the Dissolution and call upon their strength to overcome the Desecration.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nIt’s common for a people with such long histories of alliances and respect for community to abide respectfully within society. Wayang society also has positive perceptions toward less pragmatic individuals; many resourceful wayang explorers and artisans embrace attitudes of curiosity and free-spiritedness. Life in darkness teaches the value of skepticism while discouraging moral absolutism or extremism. Wayangs are seldom cruel, perhaps as conscious rejections of the Desecration. Though few champion great causes, many practice quiet benevolence and empathy for those also suffering from oppression or cruelty. \n\nWayang religion is largely syncretic, incorporating Iroran austerities of meditation and self-mastery, [Sangpotshi](/Deities.aspx?ID=202) and [Pharasman](/Deities.aspx?ID=290) metaphysics of planar transmigration, and beliefs in the Netherworld’s indigenous spirits and ancestors. Gods are generally seen as tutelary spirits who can help individual supplicants gain supernatural power. In particular, many invoke [Lao Shu Po](/Deities.aspx?ID=312), whom wayangs call Sister Mousedeer. Her cleverness and ability to outmaneuver more powerful divinities and repurpose their power proves especially inspiring to anti-colonial efforts. Ascetics seeking power and wisdom also emulate [Ragdya](/Deities.aspx?ID=194) and [Diomazul](/Deities.aspx?ID=190). Notably, despite valuing community and civilization, few worship Abadar due to his place in condemning the Netherworld to Zon-Kuthon's debasement. Ironically, some fallen wayangs have become Kuthite adherents and now strive to capture and torment their former fellows.\n\n**Popular Edicts** act selflessly toward your community, make powerful allies, reject the Desecration of darkness, seek inspiration for your art\n\n**Popular Anathema** cause a creature unnecessary pain, make compromises in the pursuit of freedom, sell your creations without concern, talk openly about the Dissolution\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nPutri Rubah Hebat, Hakim Gunung Api, Raja Ribut Hitam, Adik Musang\n<title level=\"2\">Wayang Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nSmall\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nDexterity, Charisma, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nConsitution\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Shadowtongue](/Languages.aspx?ID=21)\r\n\r\n[Wayang](/Languages.aspx?ID=180)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Physical Description The rigors of an interplanar struggle and life on or near the seas of Tian Xia grant many wayangs wiry frames, and many carry themselves with a gravitas that belies their small stature. Despite long journeys under cloudless skies, wayangs' skin (ranging from ivory white to duskwood black) doesn't sunburn easily, a blessing attributed to the darkness's love for its children. Thick shadows flit and dance almost like a second layer of skin upon wayang bodies, sheltering them from the sun's glare. Wayangs further decorate their skin with intricate patterns of paint, which non-wayangs often misinterpret as scarification or tattoos. With concentration and training, wayangs can move their shadows independently of their body, an ability that both warriors and storytellers use to great effect, either in aiding their ambushes or illustrating their performances. Wayangs tend to grow their hair long, construct elaborate headdresses of shell and horn to hold their hair up in immaculate hairstyles, and favor long scarves or shawls over their shoulders. Society Wayang society encompasses many tensions between communal and individualistic behaviors. While wayangs organize themselves into collectives modeled after agrarian villages or seafaring crews where everyone has to do their part for the shared betterment, hermits and iconoclasts are also afforded special places in wayang society. While individual wayang villages or ships might look to their leaders for direction in everyday matters, these leaders in turn also look to solitary gurus and unconventional visionaries for guidance and inspiration. The wayang political universe is composed of multiple overlapping mandalas, concentrations of influence around central charismatic and powerful figures, such as experienced chieftains, ingenious artisans, or intrepid captains. In turn, these individual concentrations cohere around yet other figures famed for righteousness or wisdom, such as sagacious teachers, virtuous princes, or masterful occultists. This approach to social power is useful for organizing diverse diasporas scattered across islands and planes; each collective practices sufficient independence to pursue their own journeys while retaining enough interdependence to respond to others' calls for help and friendship. Wayang interactions with other communities usually take place as visiting artisans bearing handcrafted goods of precious materials and exquisite quality. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these items also provide potent supernatural protection against fiends and undead. Despite the high demand, wayangs don't sell them, but instead offer them freely only to those blessed by shadows, such as particular sorcerer bloodlines. Wayang emissaries use these gifts to aid potential allies and strengthen them against other forces of darkness. In time, many also hope to instruct their newfound friends in the secrets of the Dissolution and call upon their strength to overcome the Desecration. Alignment and Religion It’s common for a people with such long histories of alliances and respect for community to abide respectfully within society. Wayang society also has positive perceptions toward less pragmatic individuals; many resourceful wayang explorers and artisans embrace attitudes of curiosity and free-spiritedness. Life in darkness teaches the value of skepticism while discouraging moral absolutism or extremism. Wayangs are seldom cruel, perhaps as conscious rejections of the Desecration. Though few champion great causes, many practice quiet benevolence and empathy for those also suffering from oppression or cruelty. Wayang religion is largely syncretic, incorporating Iroran austerities of meditation and self-mastery, Sangpotshi and Pharasman metaphysics of planar transmigration, and beliefs in the Netherworld’s indigenous spirits and ancestors. Gods are generally seen as tutelary spirits who can help individual supplicants gain supernatural power. In particular, many invoke Lao Shu Po, whom wayangs call Sister Mousedeer. Her cleverness and ability to outmaneuver more powerful divinities and repurpose their power proves especially inspiring to anti-colonial efforts. Ascetics seeking power and wisdom also emulate Ragdya and Diomazul. Notably, despite valuing community and civilization, few worship Abadar due to his place in condemning the Netherworld to Zon-Kuthon's debasement. Ironically, some fallen wayangs have become Kuthite adherents and now strive to capture and torment their former fellows.

Affronted fey aristocrats saw yaksha sanctuaries as a challenge to their authority, and the stolid plainness of yaksha domains offended the fey's aesthetic sensitivities.

Instead, these guardian spirits occasionally manifest when two conditions are met: a surfeit of positive emotions must exist within an untamed area, and a great need for protection must arise within this land. When both conditions are met, yakshas might appear to answer common folk's prayers and protect the beleaguered land.\n\nYakshas often appear as humans with strikingly distinctive physiques; while some stand around 7 feet with powerfully muscled statures, others boast robust portliness and stand no more than 4 feet. All possess luxurious, banyan-like manes of hair that they bind in topknots or under headscarves. The primal power of yaksha vows can sustain them for a thousand years. Ironically, due to perilous nature of their vows, few yakshas live more than a century.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nMost yakshas eschew pomp and disregard civilization's excesses. Instead, they gather in provincial sects or assimilate among borderland peoples. While some of the First World's yakshas reigned from kingly temple-cities, Tian Xia's yakshas discourage such grandiosity. Contemporary yakshas attribute love of lucre and prestige as temptations that led some of their number to join the Great Abandonment. Gathering in large numbers also attracted the wrath of the cruel. When the First World's yakshas sheltered weaker fey within their temple-cities, offended fey gentry launched war after war upon them. Thus, most yakshas keep to the margins of society today and do what they can to help the world around them. Where the poor and humble can be found, yakshas might also dwell to serve as protectors or avengers, enshrined in the lowborn's forlorn hopes and desperate wishes.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Alignment and Religion</title>\r\nAs guardian spirits, many yakshas are drawn toward benevolence. Their existence advocates adhering to vows and emphasizes empathy and service, which nurtures compassion. Few, though, are both kind and disciplined; witnessing divine desertion and imperial injustice has caused yakshas to doubt the efficacy and fairness of a hierarchal society, and such skepticism makes it hard for them to feel impartial about such communities. It isn't unheard of for yakshas to act recklessly and without consideration for their vows. Wildhaired, ferocious yakshas have been known to devour entire taboo-violating villages, and [Iroran](/Deities.aspx?ID=286) stories mention forest monastics taming such marauding yakshas to lead them upon the path of repentance and enlightenment. \n\nThe popularity of Iroran teachings among otherwise religion-averse yakshas gives these stories credence. Irori's lessons of self-mastery sit easily alongside yaksha discipline, and Irori's mortal origins helps temper yakshas' typical disdain for divinity. [Yamatsumi's](/Deities.aspx?ID=319) worship is also not uncommon, though yaksha adherents often couch prayers as respectful requests to a more powerful sibling rather than supplications to a superior. While yakshas stridently oppose [Lady Nanbyo's](/Deities.aspx?ID=311) calamitous doctrines, they reserve their greatest antipathy for other god-spurning beings, and they relentlessly battle the cults of rakshasa immortals and asura ranas. \n\n**Popular Edicts** guide the lost and weary, provide refuge to the weak and downtrodden, swear primordial vows \n\n**Popular Anathema** break a vow, gorge yourself on the extravagance of civilization\n\n<title level=\"2\">Names</title>\r\nAhimsaka, Fanren Meng, Hariti, Iryoku, Janavasbha, Kyoju- Yasha, Mahavana, Osugi, Pattana, Tataka, Wu Shizhi\n<title level=\"2\">Yaksha Mechanics</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Hit Points</title>\r\n8\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Size</title>\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Speed</title>\r\n25 feet\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nConstitution, Charisma, Free\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Attribute Flaws</title>\r\nIntelligence\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">Languages</title>\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n[Common](/Languages.aspx?ID=155)\r\n\r\n[Fey](/Languages.aspx?ID=119)\r\n\r\n[Yaksha](/Languages.aspx?ID=181)\r\n\r\nAdditional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Few, though, are both kind and disciplined; witnessing divine desertion and imperial injustice has caused yakshas to doubt the efficacy and fairness of a hierarchal society, and such skepticism makes it hard for them to feel impartial about such communities. It isn't unheard of for yakshas to act recklessly and without consideration for their vows. Wildhaired, ferocious yakshas have been known to devour entire taboo-violating villages, and Iroran stories mention forest monastics taming such marauding yakshas to lead them upon the path of repentance and enlightenment. The popularity of Iroran teachings among otherwise religion-averse yakshas gives these stories credence. Irori's lessons of self-mastery sit easily alongside yaksha discipline, and Irori's mortal origins helps temper yakshas' typical disdain for divinity. Yamatsumi's worship is also not uncommon, though yaksha adherents often couch prayers as respectful requests to a more powerful sibling rather than supplications to a superior. While yakshas stridently oppose Lady Nanbyo's calamitous doctrines, they reserve their greatest antipathy for other god-spurning beings, and they relentlessly battle the cults of rakshasa immortals and asura ranas.

while some stand around 7 feet with powerfully muscled statures, others boast robust portliness and stand no more than 4 feet. all possess luxurious, banyan-like manes of hair that they bind in topknots or under headscarves. the primal power of yaksha vows can sustain them for a thousand years. ironically, due to perilous nature of their vows, few yakshas live more than a century. society most yakshas eschew pomp and disregard civilization's excesses. instead, they gather in provincial sects or assimilate among borderland peoples. while some of the first world's yakshas reigned from kingly temple-cities, tian xia's yakshas discourage such grandiosity. contemporary yakshas attribute love of lucre and prestige as temptations that led some of their number to join the great abandonment. gathering in large numbers also attracted the wrath of the cruel. when the first world's yakshas sheltered weaker fey within their temple-cities, offended fey gentry launched war after war upon them. thus, most yakshas keep to the margins of society today and do what they can to help the world around them. where the poor and humble can be found, yakshas might also dwell to serve as protectors or avengers, enshrined in the lowborn's forlorn hopes and desperate wishes. alignment and religion as guardian spirits, many yakshas are drawn toward benevolence. their existence advocates adhering to vows and emphasizes empathy and service, which nurtures compassion. few, though, are both kind and disciplined;

It's faster to conclude that if something exists, so long as it basks in the perfect conditions for enough time—usually on the scale of thousands of years—it might just become a yaoguai. Yaoguai inherit a wide range of features based on their pre-awakened form; a yaoguai born of animals might have fur or pointed ears; one derived from an object might have stone- or metal-like skin. Due to their wild appearances, many adventuring yaoguai travel by night, which invites suspicion. Thus, shapeshifting into a humanoid form is one of the many arts yaoguai practice meticulously, even if all they can achieve is a form that retains many of their yaoguai features. Some yaoguai prefer such a form. Perhaps they're confident that they have nothing to hide or they like the ease of access to their yaoguai powers in this incomplete form. Others aim to perfect their humanoid form until they become indistinguishable from any other humanoid creature. \n\nMany yaoguai are born adults, though their humanoid forms can be of any apparent age. The average life span of yaoguai, in general, is often a reflection of their power. The most powerful yaoguai can easily challenge the life span of [dragons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=395), living up to several thousand years, if not becoming agelessly immortal. Rumors abound, therefore, that yaoguai might have ruled much of Tian Xia once upon a time.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Society</title>\r\nRoughly three types of yaoguai exist: those who stick with other yaoguai, those who hop in and out of non-yaoguai societies, and those who live among other societies in disguise. Yaoguai who keep to themselves might be solitary with a small number of associates who live a good distance away. Yaoguai of similar origins might share a domicile and consider themselves part of a found family, with the most senior member acting as the parental or older sibling figure. Some groups have more of a master-student or ruler-retainer dynamic, particularly if the leading yaoguai is significantly more powerful. \n\nYaoguai who dip in and out of other cultures are often tricksters who prank the communities they frequent. As bothersome and malicious activity draws attention, most yaoguai groups wisely keep their pranks helpful or tasteful to ensure their longevity. The pranks in such cases might consist of completing tasks or punching up at a local despot. Unfortunately, there are always powerful entities willing to sponsor yaoguai with evil intent, which such yaoguai take as permission to rob and attack settlements without abandon. These infamous stories are the reason why yaoguai bounty hunting is a booming industry in Tian Xia and why yaoguai who live in non-yaoguai communities go to extreme lengths to keep a low profile.

experience, or transcendence, you should play a yaoguai. you might... keep an ear out for ways to attain, unlock, or train your power such that you can transcend your being. distrust the intentions of others if they're capable of harming you, especially other yaoguai. be insulted when your abilities are questioned. others probably... show interest or awe at the powers you wield or have at your disposal. are shocked and dismayed to learn that your true shape isn't the form you appear to be. assume you're malicious by nature and envious of society in general. physical description a yaoguai's original form can be virtually anything. it's faster to conclude that if something exists, so long as it basks in the perfect conditions for enough time—usually on the scale of thousands of years—it might just become a yaoguai. yaoguai inherit a wide range of features based on their pre-awakened form; a yaoguai born of animals might have fur or pointed ears; one derived from an object might have stone- or metal-like skin. due to their wild appearances, many adventuring yaoguai travel by night, which invites suspicion. thus, shapeshifting into a humanoid form is one of the many arts yaoguai practice meticulously, even if all they can achieve is a form that retains many of their yaoguai features. some yaoguai prefer such a form. perhaps they're confident that they have nothing to hide or they like the ease of access to their yaoguai powers in this incomplete form. others aim to perfect their humanoid form until they become indistinguishable from any other humanoid creature. many yaoguai are born adults, though their humanoid forms can be of any apparent age. the average life span of yaoguai, in general, is often a reflection of their power. the most powerful yaoguai can easily challenge the life span of dragons, living up to several thousand years, if not becoming agelessly immortal. rumors abound, therefore, that yaoguai might have ruled much of tian xia once upon a time. society roughly three types of yaoguai exist: those who stick with other yaoguai, those who hop in and out of non-yaoguai societies, and those who live among other societies in disguise. yaoguai who keep to themselves might be solitary with a small number of associates who live a good distance away. yaoguai of similar origins might share a domicile and consider themselves part of a found family, with the most senior member acting as the parental or older sibling figure. some groups have more of a master-student or ruler-retainer dynamic, particularly if the leading yaoguai is significantly more powerful. yaoguai who dip in and out of other cultures are often tricksters who prank the communities they frequent. as bothersome and malicious activity draws attention, most yaoguai groups wisely keep their pranks helpful or tasteful to ensure their longevity. the pranks in such cases might consist of completing tasks or punching up at a local despot. unfortunately, there are always powerful entities willing to sponsor yaoguai with evil intent, which such yaoguai take as permission to rob and attack settlements without abandon. these infamous stories are the reason why yaoguai bounty hunting is a booming industry in tian xia and why yaoguai who live in non-yaoguai communities go to extreme lengths to keep a low profile. often, these yaoguai live by themselves, in pairs, or in trios at most, as they fear numbers might betray their safety. alignment and religion there's the misconception that yaoguai are wicked by nature, no matter their intent or actions. this is far from the truth, especially with regard to yaoguai who live among humanoid communities or seek to transcend their being. most yaoguai can be as heroic as any other of tian xia's wandering adventurers. if a yaoguai came from an established yaoguai community, they might lean toward pragmatism, though there are also a few reckless tricksters. yaoguai who spent much of their formative years by themselves or with a very small group of compatriots are often impulsive unless they follow a cultivation school or philosophy that demands otherwise. some yaoguai are particularly susceptible to the influence of their environment and peers, meaning they change their opinions more easily and rapidly than other ancestries. various yaoguai enclaves revere shizuru and tsukiyo, as it's believed that the power of sunlight and moonlight grants most yaoguai their awakening. qi zhong is often cited and worshipped as the guiding teacher of the first yaoguai who ascended to divinity, sun wukong. though sun wukong ascended through dubiously ethical methods, nearly all yaoguai know of his tales and exploits, even if the monkey king isn't a particularly popular subject of worship.
