Alghollthus shaped their servitors and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. The rulers of the alghollthus, the so-called “veiled masters,” further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled.\n\n In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with upstart surface societies and meddling gods. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the will to survive of those they treated as their pawns, and in time the world recovered, this time free of alghollthu influence.\n\n Today, the alghollthus have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question.

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture.\n\n Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.\n\n According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched.\n\n In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds—a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.\n\n In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Anugobu Apprentice](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1392) (Creature 3), [Anugobu Wondercrafter](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1393) (Creature 7)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Anugobu Tools</title>\r\n\r\nAnugobus need a bewildering variety of fine handmade tools for their crafts, and human-sized tools simply won't do.

The aura uses the moderate DC for the beheaded's level. Furious Headbutt Single Action Frequency once per round; Effect The beheaded makes a wild Strike, taking a –2 penalty to its AC until the end of its next turn.

This variety can lead to extremely distinctive beheaded, including dragon heads, giant insect heads, medusa heads, or those of even rarer creatures. Occasionally, such beheaded retain weakened versions of their original special abilities from the constituent creature instead of a beheaded ability, such as a breath weapon for a dragon head or a gaze for a medusa head. More Beheaded Abilities Since beheaded are very similar to skeletons or zombies (or at least the heads from those creatures), you can also customize them with abilities from the skeleton and zombie entries, though take care to avoid abilities that require bodies or limbs.

Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert.\n\n The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque—some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Winding Clockworks</title> A clockwork must be wound to remain operational. Each clockwork has the wind-up ability, with the specifics listed in its stat block. \n\n**Wind-Up** For a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.\n\n A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception).

Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert. The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque—some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner. Winding Clockworks A clockwork must be wound to remain operational. Each clockwork has the wind-up ability, with the specifics listed in its stat block. Wind-Up For a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m. A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a –2 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate). A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time.

Svirfneblins, as deep gnomes call themselves, have skin the color of gray or brown stone. While deep gnome males are bald, women have thin, pale-gray hair, and all have the large, expressive eyes typical among all gnomes. A deep gnome is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 65 pounds. Deep gnomes rarely interact with those outside of their small cavern communities, and they are slow to trust outsiders, sometimes keeping them imprisoned for years simply to prevent them from informing others of the deep gnome settlement.\n\n The first deep gnomes rose in the underground world some time after their early gnome ancestors migrated from the First World to Golarion. A group of these migrants elected to settle underground instead of on the surface, and it was from these gnomes that the svirfneblin came to be. Some believe the gnomes chose the Darklands as their home to watch for and stop any evil fey who might infiltrate the underground region, but much like the exact reasons for the gnomes' relocation, their motivation has been lost to time. Thousands of years of living in subterranean caverns with little to no light transformed the physical characteristics of the gnomes living there into those of the deep gnome of today.\n\n Though deep gnomes may seem dour and recalcitrant at first glance, they retain the fey blood of their ancestors. In fact, deep gnomes are sometimes more emotionally erratic than their gnome cousins, lashing out violently at what seems like the smallest provocation. Such an explosion is often followed by an extended period of quiet brooding. Despite this, deep gnome communities are close-knit, as each citizen knows when to give the others the space they require to process their feelings.\n\n Many deep gnome settlements have clashed with nearby [duergar](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=38) communities for myriad reasons: resources, territory, and even religion and morality. Over the centuries, some of these disputes have evolved into full wars, with many lives lost on both sides. Neither deep gnomes nor duergars are particularly proud of these conflicts, but both insist they were in the right each time. The ferocity with which most duergars fight has left a deep impression on the psyches of some deep gnome communities, leading them to distrust all dwarves and dwarf-like ancestries even more than other strangers.

Barbatos is the doorwarden of Hell's uppermost layer, while Dispater rules Hell's largest city. Mammon guards Hell's treasuries, and Belial designs new weapons for Hell's legions.

By far the most common dhampirs are svetochers, the children of the more common moroi vampires.\n\n Many dhampirs grow up as orphans because their mortal parent perished as a result of a difficult childbirth, or else they believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them. Often outcast, some dhampirs leverage their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them, while others struggle to form even basic relationships. Mistrust of a dhampir's ancestry presents further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into mortal society. Those who seek out their vampiric parent often find themselves judged as inferior, rejected as they were by mortals but for different reasons. But in regions like Nidal, Geb, and Ustalav, where vampires are viewed with some degree of respect, dhampirs can find their heritage empowering.\n\n Dhampirs fill countless roles within many communities. Some prefer to blend in as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir's mortal parent, but a rare few are born as dhampirs themselves). Those who learn to make the most of their inherited charm can achieve high societal status, whether leveraging traditional avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir's abilities. With a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive influence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. Further, their ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Dhampir Wizard](/NPCs.aspx?ID=2913) (Creature 2)","search_text":" dhampir source monster core pg. 95 1.1 as the mortal offspring of a vampire and a living parent, dhampirs occupy an unusual place among the living. their vampiric parentage lends them elongated incisors, an unearthly beauty and physical grace, ghostly pallor, and a piercing gaze. perhaps their most distinctive feature, however, is their connection to energy from the void, which heals them, leaving them as vulnerable to life energy as any undead creature. though they don't suffer the full range of a vampire's vulnerabilities, they do share certain characteristics with their vampire parent, leading to several distinct dhampir heritages across golarion. by far the most common dhampirs are svetochers, the children of the more common moroi vampires. many dhampirs grow up as orphans because their mortal parent perished as a result of a difficult childbirth, or else they believed their child to be cursed and abandoned them. often outcast, some dhampirs leverage their charisma and personal magnetism to manipulate those around them, while others struggle to form even basic relationships. mistrust of a dhampir's ancestry presents further challenges when dhampirs attempt to integrate into mortal society. those who seek out their vampiric parent often find themselves judged as inferior, rejected as they were by mortals but for different reasons. but in regions like nidal, geb, and ustalav, where vampires are viewed with some degree of respect, dhampirs can find their heritage empowering. dhampirs fill countless roles within many communities. some prefer to blend in as best they can, holding regular jobs and building families (most children born to dhampirs share an ancestry with the dhampir's mortal parent, but a rare few are born as dhampirs themselves). those who learn to make the most of their inherited charm can achieve high societal status, whether leveraging traditional avenues of power or gathering followers enamored by the dhampir's abilities. with a lifespan rivaling that of an elf, a dhampir can develop extensive influence and engage in long-reaching schemes of massive scope. further, their ancestry lends them a proclivity to necromancy and the occult arts. members dhampir wizard (creature 2)","features":null},{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Dhuthorex","creature_family_markdown":"Dhuthorex","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-283","image":["/Images/Monsters/Dhuthorex.png"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Dhuthorex](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=283)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Pathfinder #165: Eyes of Empty Death](/Sources.aspx?ID=81) pg. 80\n\nStrange things swim in sunless seas, but few as fierce as the shark-like dhuthorexes.

Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty—be it by claw, tooth, or breath—and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Shape-Changing Dragons</title> Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature.

To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Chromatic Dragons of Golarion</title> The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons.\n\n Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei.\n\n<title level=\"2\">Group Families</title>\r\n[Dragon, Black](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=165), [Dragon, Blue](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=166), [Dragon, Green](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=167), [Dragon, Red](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=168), [Dragon, White](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=169)\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Apsu</title>\r\n\r\nApsu, the Waybringer, is the god of good dragons, leadership, and peace.

Shape-Changing Dragons Some dragons can take humanoid form, allowing them to infiltrate settlements or influence others without revealing their true nature. They gain the following ability: Change Shape Single Action (arcane, concentrate, polymorph, transmutation) The dragon takes on the appearance of any Small or Medium humanoid. This doesn’t change its Speed or attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). Chromatic Dragon Spellcasters Each type of chromatic dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a chromatic dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon’s Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give it the spells outlined in its sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other arcane spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each level. You might also want to increase the dragon’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect its mastery of magic. Chromatic Dragons of Golarion The chromatic dragons that dwell around the Inner Sea region are cruel and sinister monsters who inspire as much fear as reverence. These terrible beasts are no mere myth, however, but a very real threat to the people with whom they share their lands. Most dwell in the wild places of the world, and only the most brazen of them regularly meddle in mortal affairs. The dragons of Golarion believe that they are descended from two original beings, Apsu and Tiamat, and their rich mythology attempts to explain the origins of the age-old war between chromatic and metallic dragons. Black dragons thrive in swampy wildernesses like the Mushfens in Varisia or the wrecked coastline now known as the Sodden Lands, while blue dragons prefer the sand-swept deserts of Thuvia and Osirion. Brutish green dragons roam the forests of the River Kingdoms in abundance and even the elven kingdom of Kyonin, particularly in the demon-tainted Tanglebriar. One of the most infamous red dragons, Aashaq, a wyrm priestess of the draconic god Dahak, makes her home among the isles of the Shackles, where she lords over her followers and leads raids throughout the Inner Sea region. White dragons, though they may be found in virtually any mountain range in Avistan, are perhaps most prevalent around the Crown of the World, where they threaten travelers caravaning across the Path of Aganhei. Group Families Dragon, Black, Dragon, Blue, Dragon, Green, Dragon, Red, Dragon, White Apsu Apsu, the Waybringer, is the god of good dragons, leadership, and peace. According to draconic lore, Apsu spawned the dragon-gods who created the world. One of his sons is the destructive draconic god Dahak. Thus, Apsu is not only seen as a god and creator to good dragons, but he also serves as an immortal father figure. Dahak Dahak, the Endless Destruction, is an ancient dragon god spawned by the righteous Apsu. Dahak is the god of destruction, evil dragons, and greed. After his birth, Dahak made his way to Hell where he roamed for ages before returning to the Material Plane to fight against his father and siblings, reveling in destruction and pledging to destroy the world.

Members Ghost Commoner (Creature 4), Ghost Mage (Creature 10) Creating a Ghost You can also use the following guidelines to turn living creatures into ghosts. Increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and increase all other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level. Ghost Abilities A ghost gains the ghost, incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become unholy. The base creature loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid, and any abilities or traits that rely on it being a living, corporeal creature. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. Darkvision Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. Rejuvenation (divine) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Void Healing Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch , spirit, or vitality; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. Fly Speed equal to its Speed Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. Special Abilities Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes. For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level. Corrupting Gaze Two Actions The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage plus 1d6 for every 2 levels the ghost has with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Draining Touch Two Actions With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level. Frightful Moan Single Action (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.

If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with disintegrate ), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.

Herexens seek vengeance against the deity they once worshipped, defiling temples, slaying the faithful, and rallying lesser undead and death cultists to aid them in their unholy quests. Though a herexen's divine gifts have mostly been corrupted into the vileness of undeath, they stubbornly cling to remnants of their former power, still wielding magic and armaments favored by the deity they so greatly despise.\n\n Groups of herexens that blasphemed against the same deity sometimes combine to form a mockery of a congregation, conducting blasphemous rites with something approaching euphoria. These congregations are often formed from a blasphemous cult whose members practiced their heresy together in life and died together, though some gather independent herexens of the same former faith. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Herexen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3049) (Creature 2)\n\n<title level=\"2\">Building Herexens</title>\r\n\r\nThe herexen presented in the stat block below was originally a cleric of Pharasma, but there are as many kinds of herexens as there are deities.

Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain resources or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray skin.\n\n Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes to military leadership is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors.\n\n Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society—blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like—know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and thus hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don't usually engage in trade with other ancestries, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Hobgoblin Archer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3054) (Creature 4), [Hobgoblin General](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3055) (Creature 6), [Hobgoblin Soldier](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3053) (Creature 1)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Hobgoblins and Magic</title>\r\n\r\nHobgoblins generally distrust magic, especially arcane magic, which they derisively call “elf magic.” In the absence of magic, they wholeheartedly embrace alchemy, combining it with their natural aptitude for engineering to great destructive effect.

Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead kholo, which they consider an insult to that kholo's memory and an implication that their flesh is unworthy of consumption.

Though they feel unnatural cravings and resemble corpses, mortics live, breathe, eat, sleep, and procreate. However, a mortic can suspend their living functions simply by holding their breath, becoming more like a true undead.\n\n Mortics are largely new to Golarion, with most created in droves when the Whispering Tyrant destroyed entire cities with his _Radiant Fire_, a magical explosion fueled by the collision of negative and positive energy. From among the corpses of these tragedies rose mortics, living survivors mistaken for corpses and left behind as a result. They found themselves in a twilight state—neither fully alive or undead. The necrotic pollutants of the Gravelands and the Isle of Terror continue to create mortics, seeping into neighboring lands through the air, earth, and water to infect the populace. Though most of the living in these lands fear becoming transformed, some believe becoming a mortic is their best chance of survival in the face of the encroaching hordes of the dead.\n\n A mortic's powers differ by ancestry, though they do have a few commonalities. Reading or hearing scripture induces headaches, and they experience great discomfort when treading upon sacred ground. For those who were religious in life, these new changes can be devastating.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Angheuvore Flesh-Gnawer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1234) (Creature 2), [Etioling Blightmage](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1237) (Creature 10), [Gurgist Mauler](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1235) (Creature 6), [Jitterbone Contortionist](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1881) (Creature 4), [Lifeleecher Brawler](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1236) (Creature 8), [Relictner Eroder](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1882) (Creature 12), [Shadern Immolator](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1880) (Creature 1)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Fun and Games</title>\r\n\r\nMany mortics favor games to pass the time.

Physically, they resemble massive snakes, though they often wear jewelry and other ornaments that clearly separate them from their animal kin. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. They keep their own counsel, viewing their cosmic role to be sacrosanct and beyond the understanding of outside scholars.

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon—or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. They cut imposing figures, standing 14 feet tall and weighing 800 pounds.\n\n Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the [First World](/Planes.aspx?ID=35) is complex. Many among norns serve [Magdh](/Deities.aspx?ID=97) the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod.

instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. a nymph queen also gains the nymph's beauty aura and the focus beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen's original type. she gains the inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the change shape ability to change her form. finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level. tied to the land a nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region. as long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract any spell that would harm the environment (such as the blight ritual), using her spell dc with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank druid spell she can cast. when the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. in that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region. nymph's beauty (aura, emotion, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen's entry. change shape single action (polymorph, primal) nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any small or medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form. focus beauty single action (emotion, mental, primal, visual) the nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target, who must attempt a save against her nymph's beauty aura. if the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry. a nymph queen can focus beauty on a given creature only once per turn. inspiration three actions (emotion, mental, primal) the nymph queen inspires a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair, though it can be some other significant object as well. as long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with her, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all crafting checks, performance checks, and will saves. if the nymph grants her token to a bard, and she's the bard's muse, the queen chooses one additional benefit granted by her token: a +1 status bonus to all lore checks, a +2 status bonus to performance checks when determining the effects of compositions, a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks, or a +2 status bonus to will saves against fey. members dryad (creature 3), dryad queen (creature 13), naiad (creature 1), naiad queen (creature 7) artistic treasures nymphs favor art over any other types of material possession, often collecting the finest pieces they can and endeavoring to create their own. nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse. harmonious landscapes nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise. inspirations for art nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph's favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort's final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic. other nymphs naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. hesperides, for example, are warders of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.

Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are usually as strong as they are vicious. The worst ogres are sadists, enjoying remorseless murder, torture, and violence in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids—the smaller the better—ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.\n\n Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense.

Creating Phantoms Phantom creatures have statistics similar to those they held as physical beings. You can turn an existing living creature into a phantom by trading their usual traits for the ethereal, incorporeal, and spirit traits. Their Strikes gain the magical trait (and the finesse trait, for melee Strikes) and the phantom gets the phantom touch ability.

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners.\n\n A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Ravener](/Monsters.aspx?ID=783) (Creature 21), [Ravener Husk](/Monsters.aspx?ID=784) (Creature 14)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Ravener Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nCunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on.

In certain unique conditions, such as the intervention of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without the use of this rite at all. A ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster.

Creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like [celestials](/Traits.aspx?ID=23) and [fiends](/Traits.aspx?ID=70), appear brighter to this sense. \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious \n\n**Cowering Fear** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=206), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) A ravener's [frightful presence](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=17) causes creatures to cower in fear as well.

A soul ward has 150 maximum Hit Points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. Whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 Hit Point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 Hit Point is instead dealt to their soul ward. If this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 Hit Points, the ravener is destroyed. A soul ward's Hit Points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as Consume Soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. A ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using Consume Soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 Hit Points each day until they feed.

The victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as [_miracle_](/Spells.aspx?ID=196) or [_wish_](/Spells.aspx?ID=377), and the ravener adds a number of Hit Points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level.\n\n**Discorporate** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Trigger** The ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 Hit Points in their soul ward; **Effect** The ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. They take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used Discorporate. \n\n**Ravenous Breath** A ravener's Breath Weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. Any creature that fails its save against the ravener's Breath Weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). If at least one creature is drained by the ravener's Breath Weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 Hit Points. \n\n**Vicious Criticals** The ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. Additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their Strikes, the target must succeed on a Fortitude save or gain the [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) condition. If the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. Whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 Hit Points.","name":"Ravener","primary_source":"Bestiary 2","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary 2 pg. 222","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 222 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThough their lifespans can measure in millennia, all dragons must eventually perish.

While many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. As with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. Peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. These dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners. A ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. What they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. This new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. This hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. A ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk. Members Ravener (Creature 21), Ravener Husk (Creature 14) Ravener Lairs Cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. Some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form . Of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they'll starve. Ravener Minions Raveners view most undead creatures with little more respect than they have for living creatures, but they often make use of them as servants. They prefer incorporeal undead such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths over such crude and simple minions as skeletons and zombies. Ravener Patrons While most dragons are too prideful to turn to anyone, even the gods, for help, a few who seek to become raveners are so desperate to stave off death that they might turn to powerful patrons for aid, such as demon lords, evil deities, or powerful necromancers, offering service in exchange for their transformation.

millennia, all dragons must eventually perish. while many do so on the blades or under the spells of dragonslayers, some manage to outlast their enemies and must, in time, face the truth that awaits all living creatures at the end of their natural lifespan. as with many other creatures, some dragons respond to such looming reminders of their own mortality poorly, and the particularly prideful or wrathful of their kind often lash out in anger when confronted by this grim truth. peace and acceptance may find some dragons, but the most stubborn of their ilk (and invariably the most wicked) may pursue a different answer to the problem. these dragons seek out sinister rites that can transform them into undead creatures known as raveners. a ravener’s flesh is stripped away as part of the transformation, leaving only their skeleton. what they lose in flesh, however, the dragon gains in soul-rending power, as their raw spiritual energy forms a protective barrier around their skeleton, keeping it intact and allowing flight with now-skeletal wings. this new existence is not so easy to maintain as other forms of undeath, however, and the ravener must feed regularly on the souls of living creatures to power their profane metabolism. this hunger is much greater than that of a living dragon, so raveners are forced to relocate regularly, traveling to fresh hunting grounds each time they strip their current home of prey. a ravener may depopulate whole regions at a time in order to sate their endless hunger for souls, lest they lose much of their power and become a ravener husk. members ravener (creature 21), ravener husk (creature 14) ravener lairs cunning and paranoid, raveners prefer to make their lairs in places hostile to mortal life: atop peaks so high that living creatures struggle to breathe the rarefied air, submerged beneath pools of magma in the caldera of an active volcano, and so on. some raveners even go so far as to deliberately fill their entire lair with lethally poisonous gases, and raveners that are capable of advanced spellcasting often seal their lairs completely, accessing them exclusively by spells such as teleport or gaseous form . of course, raveners must feed on the living to persist, so they never locate their lairs so far from sources of life that they'll starve. ravener minions raveners view most undead creatures with little more respect than they have for living creatures, but they often make use of them as servants. they prefer incorporeal undead such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths over such crude and simple minions as skeletons and zombies. ravener patrons while most dragons are too prideful to turn to anyone, even the gods, for help, a few who seek to become raveners are so desperate to stave off death that they might turn to powerful patrons for aid, such as demon lords, evil deities, or powerful necromancers, offering service in exchange for their transformation. ravener spellcasters instead of gaining the vicious criticals ability, a ravener spellcaster gains additional spellcasting prowess. when creating your own ravener spellcaster, give it the spellcasting ability of a spellcaster roughly 2 levels higher than a normal spellcasting dragon of its kind. this typically means that if the original dragon had two spells prepared of its highest level, you should add one more spell of that level and then two spells of the next highest level, while if it had three spells prepared of its highest level, you would add three spells of the next highest level (if applicable, add only a single 10th-level spell). either way, increase its cantrip level by 1. if the ravener is unusually young, you might be able to use spells from the relevant spellcasting dragon sidebar, but for a typical ancient dragon, consider the following spells to fill in the new slots, depending on which level of spells you need. 10th wish 9th power word kill , telepathic demand , weird 8th disappearance , maze , mind blank 7th contingency , energy aegis , spell turning ravener treasure because they change lairs more often than living dragons, raveners prefer treasure that is compact and easily transported. instead of sprawling mountains of coins, they tend to prefer precious gems, art objects, and especially magic items, particularly magic items they are capable of using. creating a ravener any evil dragon of at least level 13 can become a ravener, although it is exceedingly rare for a dragon younger than an ancient true dragon (such as a chromatic, primal, or metallic dragon) to do so. typically, the dragon must perform a rare ritual called ravenous reanimation , but this requirement can be waived if the prospective ravener has the aid of a powerful patron. in certain unique conditions, such as the intervention of a vile god of undeath, a dragon can transform into a ravener after death without the use of this rite at all. a ravener is a powerful creature that is likely to have a major impact on your game, so you might want to create each one as a custom monster. if you don't have time, you can also create a ravener via the following steps. increase the dragon's level by 2 and change their statistics as follows. they gain the undead trait and the necril language. increase their ac, attack bonuses, dcs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 2. they gain weakness to good damage and more hp (see below). the ravener's melee strikes deal an additional 2d6 negative damage, and their damaging breath weapon deals an additional 4d6 persistent negative damage. ## ravener starting level hp increase weakness 13-20 50 15 21 or greater 90 20 ### ravener abilities a ravener gains the following abilities. darkvision soulsense a ravener senses the spiritual essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. creatures whose material bodies are one unit with their souls, like celestials and fiends, appear brighter to this sense. negative healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious cowering fear (aura, emotion, fear, mental) a ravener's frightful presence causes creatures to cower in fear as well. as long as a creature is at least frightened 2 or more as a result of the ravener's frightful presence, it is also immobilized from the fear. soul ward an intangible field of necromantic energy protects a ravener from total destruction. a soul ward has 150 maximum hit points, or 200 if the ravener is level 21 or higher. whenever a ravener would be reduced below 1 hit point, all damage in excess of what would reduce them to 1 hit point is instead dealt to their soul ward. if this damage reduces the soul ward to fewer than 0 hit points, the ravener is destroyed. a soul ward's hit points can be restored only via specific ravener abilities such as consume soul, ravenous breath, or vicious criticals. a ravener who goes more than a week without successfully using consume soul to feed on a dying creature starves, and their soul ward loses 1d4 hit points each day until they feed. if the ravener's soul ward loses all its hit points while the ravener still has more than 1 hp, they become a ravener husk. consume soul free action (death, divine, necromancy) trigger a living creature within 30 feet of the ravener dies; effect the ravener tears the creature's soul from its body with their maw and gulps it down. the dying creature must attempt a dc 44 fortitude save. critical success the creature is unaffected. success the ravener tears off a small chunk of the creature’s soul. if the victim is restored to life, they are drained 1 in addition to any other side effects of returning to life. the ravener adds a number of hit points to their soul ward equal to half the creature’s level. failure as success, but the creature’s soul is ravaged. the creature is drained 3 and the ravener adds a number of hit points to their soul ward equal to the creature’s level. critical failure as failure, but the ravener devours the entire soul. the victim can’t be restored to life as long as the ravener exists except via a 10th-level effect such as miracle or wish , and the ravener adds a number of hit points to their soul ward equal to twice the creature’s level. discorporate free action (divine, necromancy) trigger the ravener takes excess damage to their soul ward but still has at least 51 hit points in their soul ward; effect the ravener draws deeply into their soul ward, discorporating their body into soul energy in order to escape. they take 50 damage to their soul ward and their physical body vanishes, reappearing 1d4 hours later in a random location within 1 mile from the location where they used discorporate. ravenous breath a ravener's breath weapon is infused with negative energy and strips life essence from the victims. any creature that fails its save against the ravener's breath weapon is drained 1 (or drained 2 on a critical failure). if at least one creature is drained by the ravener's breath weapon, the ravener's soul ward gains 5 hit points. vicious criticals the ravener treats an attack roll as a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, as long as the attack roll was a success. additionally, whenever the ravener makes a critical hit with one of their strikes, the target must succeed on a fortitude save or gain the drained 1 condition. if the target already has a drained value of greater than 0, their drained value instead increases by 1, to a maximum of drained 4. whenever the ravener applies drain to a creature in this way, their soul ward gains 5 hit points.","features":null},{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Ray","creature_family_markdown":"Ray","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-149","markdown":"<title level=\"1\"

couatls saw hope and the potential to rise to achieve great feats, while sahkils saw the potential for fear. fearful mortals would never accomplish anything, becoming useless piles of flesh whose souls would languish. these withered souls would be unable to properly travel the river of souls, disrupting the delicate balance of the afterlife. to this day, couatls work to inspire mortals and push them toward greater tasks while striving to keep the sahkils' terror at bay embodiments of fear all sahkils have horrifying appearances, and each type specializes in exacerbating a specific fear in mortals. penquals embody not only a fear of crowds, but also of confined spaces and of being lost within a sea of unfamiliar faces. nenchuujes embody both the fear of magic's horrifying side effects as well as the fear that one's own magic might be twisted to an unexpected or tragic end. feeding on fear sahkils are immortal planar beings and don't require material sustenance, but they do seem to gain some semblance of nourishment from the fear they spread. whether this is psychological or biological remains to be seen, but their obsession with frightening other creatures is clear. sahkils recognize that they are already feared, so it may be that they are simply fulfilling what they believe is their ultimate purpose. planar relations sahkils collaborate with divs to corrupt and corrode mortals. velstracs, who appreciate sahkils' depredations, sometimes work with these fiends to enact terrible horror on their victims. nihilistic and disaffected, daemons tolerate sahkils but tend to view them as useless provocateurs. sahkil tormentors the most powerful among sahkils are the sahkil tormentors. these deific beings rule over sahkils as a whole, and many personally direct the actions of their lesser cousins. others fall into ambivalent routines, focusing more on their own personal acts of torment rather than launching widespread, ambitious depredations upon unsuspecting mortals. war against hope sahkils and couatls are eternal enemies. the creatures each vie for the hearts of mortals, but from different sides of a single ideological coin. sahkils wish to instill only fear into mortal hearts, trying to reduce them into useless piles of flesh who accomplish little. couatls work to light the fires of hope, inspiring mortals to rise up and achieve their potential. xibalba within the ghostly realm of the ethereal plane, sahkils inhabit a terrifying realm known as xibalba. the land of dread is a realm of nightmares made manifest. at the center of this demiplane is a tiered pyramid known as the black pyramid, where the sahkil tormentors rule their brethren and sow fear through the mortal realm.

Most siabraes use undead as minions, particularly undead animals. Occasionally they ally with a sentient undead or loathsome fey, but these tend to be alliances of convenience. Creating a Siabrae A siabrae can be made from any primal spellcaster as long as they have the ability to perform a ritual of undeath as the primary caster (which can usually be performed only by a spellcaster capable of casting 6th-level spells). To create a siabrae, follow these steps: Increase the spellcaster's level by 1 and change their statistics as follows. Increase spell DCs and spell attack rolls by 2. Siabrae Abilities A siabrae gains the earth and undead traits and becomes evil. Siabraes lose all abilities that specifically come from being a living creature of their original kind. A siabrae gains the following abilities. Darkvision Tremorsense (imprecise) 60 feet Negative Healing Rejuvenation (primal, necromancy) When a siabrae is destroyed, they can attempt a DC 10 flat check (they automatically succeed if they're standing on blighted or diseased terrain, and automatically fail if they're standing on sacred ground).

Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious Resistances fire 20, physical 15 (except magic bludgeoning) Speed The siabrae gains a burrow Speed equal to their land Speed and the earth glide ability (see below).

Furthermore, any animals the siabrae takes the form of or summons appear to be diseased, malnourished, or even dead and rotting. (This doesn't affect their statistics.)

A creature damaged by a siabrae's stone antlers Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against the siabrae's spell DC – 4 or become clumsy 2 for 1d4 rounds on a failure.

(creature 2) born of sin sinspawn retreated from the world for many centuries following the collapse of the runelords' empire, but in recent years they have emerged from ancient dungeons, strange magical pools, and other forgotten ruins. sinspawn cannot procreate, but in certain cases, incredibly powerful artifacts crafted by the runelords known as runewells can siphon off fragments of sinful memories and emotions related to the runewells' associated sins from the souls of people dying nearby, fueling the spontaneous creation of new sinspawn. when enough sinful energies have been gathered within a runewell, it vomits forth a full-grown sinspawn with no prior loyalty to a long-lost runelord. all sinspawn inherently understand the runewells' role in the propagation of their kind, and they often establish small villages near awakened runewells, hunting down sentient beings they can use to propagate their communities. sinspawn locations sinspawn are found in regions where sources for their creation remain buried in ancient ruins—in golarion, this currently limits them to the frontier lands of varisia. but as they spread, so too does the potential knowledge of crafting more of them, and fleshwarpers around the world are hoping to craft new sinspawn of their own someday soon.

These souls become frustrated, confused, and then furious at what they feel is a denial of the body they deserve, and in turn, they force vegetation to serve as their new body. Others theorize that when a body is buried in a shallow grave, the roots of grass growing down into the remains can tangle the soul and capture it.\n\n Thatchlings are intelligent and capable of speaking but rarely do so— they generally have little to say to those whose lives they covet.

Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion.

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=627) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality.\n\n **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)**<br /> [**Void Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83)<br /> **Immunities** [death ](/Traits.aspx?ID=571)effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)<br /> **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.<br /> **Vampire Vulnerabilities** All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below).</li><li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2745) of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=2316)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=74) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate ](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a  vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with [_holy water_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3001) while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul> **Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; **Effect** The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n **Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.<br /> **Create Servitor** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=580)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.<br /> **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658) actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.<br /> **[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1437) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1440) spells as guidelines. \n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a [bat swarm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45) or [giant bat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46). They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul> **Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.<br /> **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1501) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727) trait. The save DC uses the [high spell DC of the vampire's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br /> **Drink Blood** As a typical vampire, but the victim is [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) instead of 1.<br /> **Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=527), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_vapor form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1738) spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=62) while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

Creating a Vampire You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer Hit Points. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vampire Abilities All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them.

The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; Effect The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab. True Vampire Abilities Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. Create Servitor (divine, downtime) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Mist Escape Free Action Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take move actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. Children of the Night (divine, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Dominate Two Actions (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the high spell DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. Turn to Mist Single Action (air, concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the vapor form spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme. All jiang-shi gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Breathsense** 60 feet ([precise](/Rules.aspx?ID=411)). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to [Drowning and Suffocation](/Rules.aspx?ID=468) for the full rules on holding breath.) \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145), [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31) \n\n**One More Breath** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273), they're destroyed immediately \n\n**Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities** All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Success** The jiang-shi is unaffected.<br /> **Success** The jiang-shi is [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37) for 1 round.<br /> **Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.<br /> **Critical Failure** The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and [confused](/Conditions.aspx?ID=5) for 1 minute. </li></ul>**Warped Fulu** The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can [Steal](/Actions.aspx?ID=68) a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. \n\n**Rigor Mortis** The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it [prone](/Conditions.aspx?ID=31). A jiang-shi can't take the [Drop Prone](/Actions.aspx?ID=78) action. When a jiang-shi [Leap](/Actions.aspx?ID=81), it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=114) actions, such as [Attacks of Opportunity](/Actions.aspx?ID=8). \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait, and can [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Drain Qi** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirement** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the jiang-shi's reach; **Effect** The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the  victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.<br /> A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Jiang-Shi Minister Abilities</title> Those rare jiang-shi who have devoured at least a thousand victims' qi have shed many of their frailties and become able to create jiang-shi from their slain victims. These imperious undead address themselves as “ministers” or by other grandiose titles, and they mock lesser jiang-shi as mere “provincials.”\n\n Ministers gain additional jiang-shi abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not significant enough to become a minister—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular jiang-shi or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 13 before becoming a minister. \n\n**Resistances** The jiang-shi resists all physical damage (except magical [darkwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273)). \n\n**Dark Enlightenment** The jiang-shi is no longer limited to seeing living creatures with only their breathsense, and they no longer have the Revulsion vulnerability. They can perceive living creatures normally with either [darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12) or breathsense, and they can take the [Drop Prone](/Actions.aspx?ID=78) action. \n\n**Distant Steps** When the jiang-shi [Leaps](/Actions.aspx?ID=81), they can add 10 feet to the horizontal and/or vertical distance they move without affecting the Leap DC. The jiang-shi can stand and walk on water and other solid or liquid surfaces that wouldn't normally support their weight. \n\n**Tumult of the Blood** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)); The third time a jiang-shi successfully Drains Qi within a single minute, they become [quickened](/Conditions.aspx?ID=32) for 1 minute.

Jiang-Shi and Fulus A typical Tian exorcism for a jiang-shi involves the subdual of the vampire followed by a lengthy prayer to Pharasma. The exorcist then affixes a fulu charm upon the jiang-shi's brow, an object believed to ease the undead's eternal nightmares. Scorned by Heaven and Earth Jiang-shi crave qi, but are also repelled by harmonious arrangements of qi, such as that which occurs in rice, hen eggs, mirrors, and certain types of wood. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Jiang-Shi While it's best to create a jiang-shi from scratch, you can turn an existing living creature into a jiang-shi using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Reduce the creature's Speed by 10 feet, to a minimum of 15 feet. Increase the creature's damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce the creature's HP by the amount listed on the table. The jiang-shi gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except darkwood) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the jiang-shi has less HP.

A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object.

A creature can [Steal](/Actions.aspx?ID=68) a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=15) ability.

Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.<br /> A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week.

Perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. Yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before. Members Nosferatu Malefactor (Creature 10), Nosferatu Overlord (Creature 15), Nosferatu Thrall (Creature 8) Among the Living Though terrifying in appearance, nosferatus typically dwell among mortals. They might reside in a decrepit manor nestled in a quiet neighborhood. They may also occupy an abandoned castle, preying on weary travelers who mistake their lair as a haven from the elements. Building a Nosferatu Though nosferatus can't create more of their kind, many of these ancient vampires lurk in the world's various shadows, taking a variety of forms. If you have time, it's more effective to build a new nosferatu from the ground up using the standard monster creation rules, which were used to create the nosferatu thrall, nosferatu malefactor, and nosferatu overlord, but you can also use the guidelines presented under Creating a Nosferatu to turn an existing creature into a nosferatu, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific nosferatu abilities like negative healing, Feral Corruption, and Drink Blood work the same. Building a Nosferatu Thrall While a nosferatu can't turn a living creature into another nosferatu, they can create a thrall through a 1-day ritual. They can maintain a number of thralls up to their Charisma modifier; creating new thralls beyond this limit releases earlier thralls from service. You can convert any non-mindless living creature into a nosferatu thrall by applying the nosferatu thrall abilities and increasing its level by 1. A creature that's immune to mental effects can't become a nosferatu thrall. You can also build a nosferatu thrall from scratch using the monster creation rules in the Gamemastery Guide and applying the above modifications. Monster of Legend The word nosferatu has appeared in print since the mid-18th century, purported by Western Europeans to be a Romanian word for vampire, inspiring some of horror fiction's best writers. No clear etymology exists, and while it's unknown whether the word's roots are actually Romanian, the vampire itself is an enduring element of Romanian folklore. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Nosferatu You can turn an existing living creature into a nosferatu using the following steps. A creature below 8th level isn't significant enough to be a nosferatu and should likely be a regular vampire instead. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 5 feet or to 30 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce HP by the amount listed on the table. The nosferatu gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except magical wood) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the nosferatu has fewer HP. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Nosferatu Abilities If the base creature becoming a nosferatu has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the nosferatu's theme. All nosferatus gain the following abilities. Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Nosferatu Vulnerabilities Revulsion A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raise a Shield). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon , or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Plagued Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) Unlike other undead, a nosferatu isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. If the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 HP and regain their fast healing. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The nosferatu transforms into a swarm of pale-gray rats. They gain a land Speed of 30 feet and a climb Speed of 10 feet, and they become Large. Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d10 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save with a high DC for the creature's level. A creature that fails its save is exposed to plague of ancients (see below). Command Thrall Free Action (auditory, divine, mental) Requirements One of the nosferatu's thralls is present and can hear the nosferatu; Effect The nosferatu gives a single command to one of their thralls, which the thrall follows to the best of its ability during its next turn. Divine Innate Spells The nosferatu can cast telekinetic haul (heightened to half their level rounded up) three times per day as a divine innate spell. They use a high DC for their level. Plague of Ancients (disease, virulent) Saving Throw Fortitude (use a high DC for the nosferatu's level); Onset 1 day; Stage 1 drained 1 (1 day); Stage 2 drained 2 and enfeebled 2 (1 day); Stage 3 doomed 1, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 4 doomed 2, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); Stage 5 unconscious (1 day); Stage 6 death Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The nosferatu can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses a high DC for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Nosferatu Overlord Abilities A truly primeval nosferatu can gain extraordinary powers over their foes. Creatures must have lived for millennia and be 14th level or higher to become a nosferatu overlord. Air of Sickness (aura) 30 feet. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a Fortitude save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1 and takes a –2 status penalty to saves made to resist diseases and remove the sickened condition for 1 hour. Divine Innate Spells As nosferatu, but they can also cast vampiric exsanguination twice per day as a divine innate spell. Paralytic Fear Free Action (divine, emotion, fear, incapacitation, mental) Requirements The nosferatu overlord's last action was a successful claw Strike; Effect The nosferatu drags the target of the Strike close and freezes its mind in terror. The target must attempt a Will save with a moderate DC for the nosferatu's level. Critical Success The target is unaffected. Success The target is immobilized by fear until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Failure The target is restrained and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its Fortitude DC against the nosferatu's Drink Blood ability until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. Critical Failure As failure, and the target is frightened 2. Nosferatu Thrall Abilities Any creature under a nosferatu's thrall gains the following abilities. Fast Healing A nosferatu thrall gains fast healing 5 from being sustained by their master's blood. Weaknesses The strain of being controlled wears on the nosferatu thrall's mind, giving them weakness 10 to mental damage. Mindbound (divine, enchantment) A nosferatu master exerts a fierce hold over their thrall's mind. If any creature other than the thrall's master targets them with an effect that would give them the controlled condition, the thrall's master rolls a counteract check against it using their Dominate DC - 10 as the counteract check modifier. Mortal Shield Reaction Trigger The thrall's master would take damage from a Strike or spell attack and is in an adjacent square; Effect The thrall throws themself in front of their master, taking half the damage of the attack (before applying any weaknesses or resistances). The thrall's master takes the remaining damage, applying any weaknesses or resistances as normal. Rally Reaction Trigger The thrall ends their turn more than 30 feet away from their master; Effect The thrall Strides up to their Speed toward their master.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273","weakness":{},"description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 3](/Sources.aspx?ID=66) pg. 282\n\nAmong the most ancient of vampires are the nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old.

nosferatus, twisted remnants of mortals who died in great plagues of old. perhaps because of their age, nosferatus can no longer create more of their kind. yet they still lurk among the living, manipulating the hearts and minds of their prey to either serve them beyond the limits of natural life or to become sustenance for the nosferatu like so many others before. members nosferatu malefactor (creature 10), nosferatu overlord (creature 15), nosferatu thrall (creature 8) among the living though terrifying in appearance, nosferatus typically dwell among mortals. they might reside in a decrepit manor nestled in a quiet neighborhood. they may also occupy an abandoned castle, preying on weary travelers who mistake their lair as a haven from the elements. building a nosferatu though nosferatus can't create more of their kind, many of these ancient vampires lurk in the world's various shadows, taking a variety of forms. if you have time, it's more effective to build a new nosferatu from the ground up using the standard monster creation rules, which were used to create the nosferatu thrall, nosferatu malefactor, and nosferatu overlord, but you can also use the guidelines presented under creating a nosferatu to turn an existing creature into a nosferatu, adjusting the monster as you see fit. in either case, specific nosferatu abilities like negative healing, feral corruption, and drink blood work the same. building a nosferatu thrall while a nosferatu can't turn a living creature into another nosferatu, they can create a thrall through a 1-day ritual. they can maintain a number of thralls up to their charisma modifier; creating new thralls beyond this limit releases earlier thralls from service. you can convert any non-mindless living creature into a nosferatu thrall by applying the nosferatu thrall abilities and increasing its level by 1. a creature that's immune to mental effects can't become a nosferatu thrall. you can also build a nosferatu thrall from scratch using the monster creation rules in the gamemastery guide and applying the above modifications. monster of legend the word nosferatu has appeared in print since the mid-18th century, purported by western europeans to be a romanian word for vampire, inspiring some of horror fiction's best writers. no clear etymology exists, and while it's unknown whether the word's roots are actually romanian, the vampire itself is an enduring element of romanian folklore. vampire related families vampire, vampire, jiang-shi, vampire, strigoi, vampire, vetalarana, vampire, vrykolakas creating a nosferatu you can turn an existing living creature into a nosferatu using the following steps. a creature below 8th level isn't significant enough to be a nosferatu and should likely be a regular vampire instead. increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. it gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. increase ac, attack bonuses, dcs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. increase speed by 5 feet or to 30 feet, whichever results in a higher speed. increase damage with strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. if an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. reduce hp by the amount listed on the table. the nosferatu gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except magical wood) as indicated in the table. these abilities are the reason the nosferatu has fewer hp. starting level hp decrease fast healing/resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 basic nosferatu abilities if the base creature becoming a nosferatu has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. it also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. you might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the nosferatu's theme. all nosferatus gain the following abilities. darkvision negative healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep nosferatu vulnerabilities revulsion a nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. to brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must interact to do so for 1 round (similar to raise a shield). if the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. after 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a dc 25 will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. on a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). stake a magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a weapon potency rune, magic weapon , or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 hp and prevents them from healing above 0 hp, even in their coffin. staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is unconscious. if the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 hp again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. if the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed. sunlight if exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes slowed 1. the slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. if the nosferatu loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. plagued coffin restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) unlike other undead, a nosferatu isn't destroyed at 0 hp. instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. if even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. a nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. if their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 hp, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. if the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 hp and regain their fast healing. change shape single action (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) the nosferatu transforms into a swarm of pale-gray rats. they gain a land speed of 30 feet and a climb speed of 10 feet, and they become large. each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d10 piercing damage and must attempt a basic reflex save with a high dc for the creature's level. a creature that fails its save is exposed to plague of ancients (see below). command thrall free action (auditory, divine, mental) requirements one of the nosferatu's thralls is present and can hear the nosferatu; effect the nosferatu gives a single command to one of their thralls, which the thrall follows to the best of its ability during its next turn. divine innate spells the nosferatu can cast telekinetic haul (heightened to half their level rounded up) three times per day as a divine innate spell. they use a high dc for their level. plague of ancients (disease, virulent) saving throw fortitude (use a high dc for the nosferatu's level); onset 1 day; stage 1 drained 1 (1 day); stage 2 drained 2 and enfeebled 2 (1 day); stage 3 doomed 1, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); stage 4 doomed 2, drained 3, and enfeebled 3 (1 day); stage 5 unconscious (1 day); stage 6 death dominate two actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) the nosferatu can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. the save dc uses a high dc for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's dominate for 24 hours. fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 hp is insufficient to break the spell. drink blood single action (divine, necromancy) requirements the nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs strike; effect the nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. this requires an athletics check against the creature's fortitude dc. on a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the nosferatu regains hp equal to 10% of their maximum hp, gaining any excess hp as temporary hit points. drinking blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any hp to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. a nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no hp from doing so. the target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. a blood transfusion, which requires a successful dc 20 medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. nosferatu overlord abilities a truly primeval nosferatu can gain extraordinary powers over their foes. creatures must have lived for millennia and be 14th level or higher to become a nosferatu overlord. air of sickness (aura) 30 feet. a creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must attempt a fortitude save with a moderate dc for the nosferatu's level. on a failure, the creature is sickened 1 and

as a divine innate spell. paralytic fear free action (divine, emotion, fear, incapacitation, mental) requirements the nosferatu overlord's last action was a successful claw strike; effect the nosferatu drags the target of the strike close and freezes its mind in terror. the target must attempt a will save with a moderate dc for the nosferatu's level. critical success the target is unaffected. success the target is immobilized by fear until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. failure the target is restrained and takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its fortitude dc against the nosferatu's drink blood ability until the end of the nosferatu's next turn. critical failure as failure, and the target is frightened 2. nosferatu thrall abilities any creature under a nosferatu's thrall gains the following abilities. fast healing a nosferatu thrall gains fast healing 5 from being sustained by their master's blood. weaknesses the strain of being controlled wears on the nosferatu thrall's mind, giving them weakness 10 to mental damage. mindbound (divine, enchantment) a nosferatu master exerts a fierce hold over their thrall's mind. if any creature other than the thrall's master targets them with an effect that would give them the controlled condition, the thrall's master rolls a counteract check against it using their dominate dc - 10 as the counteract check modifier. mortal shield reaction trigger the thrall's master would take damage from a strike or spell attack and is in an adjacent square; effect the thrall throws themself in front of their master, taking half the damage of the attack (before applying any weaknesses or resistances). the thrall's master takes the remaining damage, applying any weaknesses or resistances as normal. rally reaction trigger the thrall ends their turn more than 30 feet away from their master; effect the thrall strides up to their speed toward their

[Shadows at Sundown](/Sources.aspx?ID=121) pg. 60\n\nThe oldest of all vampires are the strigoi. They predate ancient [nosferatus](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273) and view [moroi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures.\n\n Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the [Shadow Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=11) that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited.\n\n Some myths point to [Urgathoa](/Deities.aspx?ID=19) as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of [Zura](/Deities.aspx?ID=83). Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Strigoi Progenitor](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1944) (Creature 13)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">In Shadows</title>\r\n\r\nIn their true form as a shadow without a body, a strigoi is capable of thought and emotion and can communicate with the shadowy forms of other strigoi, but lacks any way to interact with the physical world. Countless strigoi exist in this manner on the Shadow Plane, patiently waiting for the ritual that allows mortals to invite them into reality to be discovered again.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strange Wounds</title>\r\n\r\nIconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strigoi and the Sun</title>\r\n\r\nAs long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. In so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected!\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Strigoi Servants</title>\r\n\r\nWhen a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a [strigoi servant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1955). Statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. Strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), [Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311), [Vampire, Vrykolakas](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=159)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Strigoi</title>\r\n\r\nA creature of 8th to 12th level can become a [strigoi servant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1955) (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. A creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97) instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world).

If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme.\n\n[**Greater Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)\n\n[**Negative Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)\n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), paralyze, [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [negative](/Traits.aspx?ID=118)) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38) and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.\n\n**Strigoi Weaknesses** All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:\n<ul><li>**Revulsion** Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=98)). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to [Sense Motive](/Actions.aspx?ID=85).</li><li>**Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like [_detect evil_](/Spells.aspx?ID=65), senses like [lifesense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=21), and the “corpse” taking damage from [positive](/Traits.aspx?ID=128) energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li><li>**Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes [slowed 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=35) and gains the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=17) condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.</li></ul>**Levitation** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [evocation](/Traits.aspx?ID=65), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) Strigoi can cast [_levitate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=170) at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows.\n\n**Claws** If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) and [magic](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the [moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018).\n\n**Drink Essence** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=33), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=38), or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; **Effect** The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10) and [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=37), and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.\n\n**Grab** The creature's claw attacks gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=18). When it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature.\n\n**Shadow Form** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143), [transmutation](/Traits.aspx?ID=157)) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is [stunned 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=36). The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.<br /> A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Strigoi Progenitor Abilities</title> Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor.\n\n**Resistances** The strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light.\n\n**Fly Speed** Instead of being able to _levitate_ at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly Speed equal to their land Speed. When a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow.\n\n**Create Spawn** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire.

They predate ancient nosferatus and view moroi as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures. Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the Shadow Plane that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement—that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul—may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited. Some myths point to Urgathoa as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of Zura. Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night. Members Strigoi Progenitor (Creature 13) In Shadows In their true form as a shadow without a body, a strigoi is capable of thought and emotion and can communicate with the shadowy forms of other strigoi, but lacks any way to interact with the physical world. Countless strigoi exist in this manner on the Shadow Plane, patiently waiting for the ritual that allows mortals to invite them into reality to be discovered again. Strange Wounds Iconic puncture marks on the neck of a victim drained of blood are well known to vampire hunters, but the wounds left by strigoi are stranger. When a strigoi feeds on a living victim, the site of the wound becomes bleached of color, wrinkled, and strangely cold to the touch. These conditions fade if the wound heals; if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. Full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass. Strigoi and the Sun As long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered unconscious certainly puts them at a disadvantage. As long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. In so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected! Strigoi Servants When a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a strigoi servant. Statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. Strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Strigoi A creature of 8th to 12th level can become a strigoi servant (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. A creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed moroi vampire instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world). You can turn an existing living creature into a strigoi using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows: It gains the shadow, undead, and vampire traits, and almost always becomes evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times, increase the damage by 2 instead. The strigoi gains fast healing and resistance to all physical damage except from silver weapons or weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light (such as a lit torch or a weapon targeted by the light spell, but not a flaming weapon) based on the table below. These abilities are the reason the strigoi has fewer HP. ## Strigoi Statistics Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 Basic Strigoi Abilities All strigoi gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme. Greater Darkvision Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) As with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious and loses fast healing. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally. Strigoi Weaknesses All strigoi possess the following weaknesses: Revulsion Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive. Sunlight When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like detect evil , senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed. Water Revulsion A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed. Levitation Two Actions (divine, evocation, shadow) Strigoi can cast levitate at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows. Claws If the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw Strike that deals slashing damage, and has the agile and magic traits. The damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the moderate Strike damage for a creature of its level. Drink Essence Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely. Grab The creature's claw attacks gain Grab. When it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature. Shadow Form Single Action (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. Strigoi Progenitor Abilities Powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the Shadow Plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. A creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor. Resistances The strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light. Fly Speed Instead of being able to levitate at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly Speed equal to their land Speed. When a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow. Create Spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Domain of Dusk or Drink Essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Shadow Escape Free Action Trigger The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious. Domain of Dusk Two Actions (conjuration, divine, shadow) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 negative damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (basic Fortitude save against the DC of the strigoi's level). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute. Dominate Two Actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.

The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely.<br /> A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns.

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. A victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.\n\n**Shadow Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious.\n\n**Domain of Dusk** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([conjuration](/Traits.aspx?ID=33), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [shadow](/Traits.aspx?ID=143)) With a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation.

if a strigoi feeds enough to cause death by the drained condition, a creature leaves behind a withered gray husk of a bloodless body. full autopsies on those slain in this manner reveal yet another unsettling curiosity: the brains of such victims are smooth, gray ovoids, the folds and fissures of gray matter fused together into a featureless mass. strigoi and the sun as long as they're not in shadow form, strigoi are more inconvenienced by sunlight than they are harmed by it, but being rendered unconscious certainly puts them at a disadvantage. as long as they're in an area where there's little risk of direct sunlight, such as being inside a room without exterior windows or doors, or in an underground area, some strigoi remain active during the day, only retreating to their coffins in emergencies. in so doing, these strigoi have further blended into society—there may be more of them than suspected! strigoi servants when a strigoi creates a spawn from a creature that's not powerful enough to play host to a strigoi progenitor, the resulting strigoi is often referred to simply as a strigoi servant. statistics for a typical strigoi servant appear on page 25 of this adventure. strigoi servants who escape servitude work hard to establish their own power, but rarely escape the mindset of existing only to serve their creator. vampire related families vampire, vampire, jiang-shi, vampire, nosferatu, vampire, vetalarana, vampire, vrykolakas creating a strigoi a creature of 8th to 12th level can become a strigoi servant (see page 25 of this adventure for the typical statistics for a strigoi servant); only 13th-level or higher creatures can become strigoi progenitors. a creature below 8th level infected by a strigoi becomes a free-willed moroi vampire instead (indeed, it is from this method the first moroi eventually came into the world). you can turn an existing living creature into a strigoi using the following steps. increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows: it gains the shadow, undead, and vampire traits, and almost always becomes evil. increase ac, attack bonuses, dcs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. increase damage with strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. if an ability can be used only a small number of times, increase the damage by 2 instead. the strigoi gains fast healing and resistance to all physical damage except from silver weapons or weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light (such as a lit torch or a weapon targeted by the light spell, but not a flaming weapon) based on the table below. these abilities are the reason the strigoi has fewer hp. ## strigoi statistics starting level hp decrease fast healing/resistance 8-14 -40 10 15+ -60 15 basic strigoi abilities all strigoi gain the following abilities. if the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. it also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. you might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the strigoi's theme. greater darkvision negative healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep coffin restoration (divine, necromancy, negative) as with moroi vampires, a strigoi isn't destroyed at 0 hp. instead, it falls unconscious and loses fast healing. if its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the strigoi gains 1 hp, after which its fast healing begins to function normally. strigoi weaknesses all strigoi possess the following weaknesses: revulsion strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. a strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. to brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must interact to do so for 1 round (similar to raising a shield). if the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. after 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a dc 25 will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. on a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). a strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful perception check to sense motive. sunlight when exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. it appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. a successful perception check against the strigoi's reflex dc is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its “dead” body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. spells like detect evil , senses like lifesense, and the “corpse” taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful perception check. viewing the “corpse” in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. while in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. if the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 hit points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed. water revulsion a strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). a strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. if forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. at the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a dc 5 flat check or be destroyed. levitation two actions (divine, evocation, shadow) strigoi can cast levitate at will as a divine innate spell; when they do so, they appear to ascend or descend on a coiling mass of shadows. claws if the creature had hands, its shadow solidifies around the fingers when it attacks, granting it a claw strike that deals slashing damage, and has the agile and magic traits. the damage caused by its claws should be roughly the same as the moderate strike damage for a creature of its level. drink essence single action (divine, necromancy) requirements a grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; effect the strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. this requires an athletics check against the creature's fortitude dc if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. the creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains hp equal to 10% of their maximum hp, gaining any excess hp as temporary hit points. drinking essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any hp, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). a victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. a blood transfusion, which requires a successful dc 20 medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. a victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. if the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely. grab the creature's claw attacks gain grab. when it uses this ability, its shadowy claws seem almost to latch on to any shadows cast by the grabbed creature. shadow form single action (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) the strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. in shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb speed equal to its land speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. however, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. if the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. the strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. a strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a dc 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. if it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail. strigoi progenitor abilities powerful strigoi that form from the fusion of a strigoi from the shadow plane and a living host gain additional abilities as detailed below. a creature below level 13 is not a significant enough host to become a strigoi progenitor. resistances the strigoi progenitor resists all physical damage except magical silver weapons or magical weapons that shed at least 5 feet of bright light. fly speed instead of being able to levitate at will, a strigoi progenitor gains a fly speed equal to their land speed. when a strigoi progenitor flies, it manifests batlike wings made of shadow. create spawn (divine, downtime, necromancy) if a creature dies after being reduced to 0 hp by domain of dusk or drink essence, the strigoi can turn this victim into a vampire by donating some of its own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. if the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. a victim that is 8th level or higher becomes a strigoi servant, while a lower-level victim instead becomes a moroi vampire. if a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the gm), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a will saving throw against the vampire's will dc. shadow escape free action trigger the strigoi is reduced to 0 hp; effect the strigoi uses shadow form. it can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 hp. while at 0 hp in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, unconscious. domain of dusk two actions (conjuration, divine, shadow) with a wave of its hand, the strigoi calls fourth vile ruination from the surrounding shadows, causing coils of darkness and shadowy bats, rats, and wolves to lash out at living targets in a 30-foot emanation. living creatures in this area take 1d6 negative damage +1d6 per 2 levels possessed by the strigoi (basic fortitude save against the dc of the strigoi's level). a creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. the strigoi progenitor can't use domain of dusk for 1 minute. dominate two actions (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) the vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. the save dc uses the dc of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's dominate for 24 hours. fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 hp is insufficient to break the spell. drink essence as a typical strigoi, but the victim is drained 2 and stupefied 2 instead of 1.","features":null},{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Vampire, Vetalarana","creature_family_markdown":"Vampire, Vetalarana","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-311","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 160\n\nVetalarana vampires feed on the emotions, thoughts, and memories of others. Although they are capable of feeding on animals, beings of the planes, and other intelligent [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160), only the thoughts of an intelligent, living [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91) bring a vetalarana any sense of satisfaction. Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time.\n\n A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life.\n\n A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets.\n\n When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Vetalarana Emergent](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1911) (Creature 8), [Vetalarana Manipulator](/Monsters.aspx?ID=1912) (Creature 11)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Mistaken Identity</title>\r\n\r\nConsuming thoughts is an overwhelming sensory experience that requires practice and mental discipline to master.

Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed.

The victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories.<br /> A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.<br /> A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious.

These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” \n\nVetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator.\n\n **Resistances** The vetalarana manipulator resists [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) damage and all physical damage (except [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=103) [cold iron](/Equipment.aspx?ID=375)).\n\n **Control Comatose** ([exploration](/Traits.aspx?ID=66), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [occult](/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts.

Although they are capable of feeding on animals, beings of the planes, and other intelligent undead, only the thoughts of an intelligent, living humanoid bring a vetalarana any sense of satisfaction. Slender and pale, with sunken cheeks and exceptionally long nails, vetalaranas become flushed with color and life after feeding on particularly potent emotions and thoughts, enabling some to pass as living for a short time. A vetalarana is created when a person with psychic or occult abilities dies in denial of their death, refusing to pass on to the afterlife but unable to retain their grip on life. As their spirit has no cause left undone nor debt to settle, these tenacious souls rise not as ghosts but as vetalaranas, a formidable and tenacious mind animating their own corpse in a mockery of life. A vetalarana's predations inevitably turn their victims into living husks, incapable of thought and devoid of any spark of personality. These victims fall into a senseless stupor, comatose but still living, without identity or memories. If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets. When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after. Members Vetalarana Emergent (Creature 8), Vetalarana Manipulator (Creature 11) Mistaken Identity Consuming thoughts is an overwhelming sensory experience that requires practice and mental discipline to master. Newly risen vetalaranas that consume memories too rapidly can lose sight of their identity amid the foreign thoughts in their minds. Consequently, they might return to the wrong home, abduct their prey's family, or adopt the quirks and vices of their victims. Puppeteers Vetalarana manipulators are obsessed with control. They experiment with the minds of the living, manipulating, enhancing, and erasing their victim's memories to see what changes occur. Through these mental experiments, vetalaranas learn how to control minds and lives, twisting mortals into loyal servants or unknowing puppets while erasing any record of their own interference. Thought Connoisseurs While all vetalaranas hunger for the most cherished memories and deepest secrets, vetalarana manipulators use the memories they consume to learn the skills and talents of their prey. Thus, they select their prey with great care. Each has their preferences, depending upon the skills they wish to cultivate, perhaps martial prowess, musical talent, arcane might, or enlightenment. Uses for Cold Iron Canny mortals looking to thwart a vetalarana make heavy use of cold iron. They line their sanctuaries with the material or surround comatose victims in cold iron sheets, armor, or shields. Others weave shrouds of cold iron thread or mix cold iron dust into paints and oils—though the efficacy of the latter is debatable. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vrykolakas Creating a Vetalarana While it's best to create a vetalarana from scratch, you can turn an existing living creature into a vetalarana using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually becomes evil. Increase the creature's AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vetalarana gains fast healing, resistance to mental damage, and resistance to physical damage (except cold iron) as indicated on the table. These abilities are the reason the vetalarana has less HP. ## Vetalarana Statistics Starting Level Starting Level Starting Level 3-4 –20 5 5-7 –30 7 8-14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vetalarana Abilities All vetalaranas gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. Thoughtsense (divination, mental, occult) The vetalarana senses all non-mindless creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Vetalarana Vulnerabilities All vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. Barred Senses A vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. Such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through Mental Rebirth. Revulsion A vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. A vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. Speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. A vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. After 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Vulnerable to Brain Destruction A vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 HP while unable to take mental actions, can't use Mental Rebirth. Mental Rebirth (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) Unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 HP. Instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. This creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. The creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and unconscious conditions. If the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through Drain Thoughts. After 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. Climb Speed A vetalarana gains a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the agile trait, and can Grab. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; Effect The vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains HP equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum HP, gaining any excess as temporary Hit Points. Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week. A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. As long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease. Vetalarana Manipulator Abilities Extremely powerful vetalaranas who've tasted the thoughts of hundreds of people or more become empowered by the memories and experiences they've consumed, overcoming their revulsions. They gain greater control over their comatose victims, can manipulate memories, and even paralyze with a touch. These vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” Vetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. A creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator. Resistances The vetalarana manipulator resists mental damage and all physical damage (except magical cold iron). Control Comatose (exploration, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) Frequency once per day; Effect The vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with Drain Thoughts. This has the effects of the possession spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. A comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against Control Comatose. As long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and unconscious conditions are temporarily suppressed. Drain Thoughts Single Action (divination, mental, occult) As a basic vetalarana, but the vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level modify memory spell. If the vetalarana gets a critical success on their Athletics check to Drain Thoughts, the target is stupefied 2 instead of stupefied 1. Occult Innate Spells A vetalarana manipulator has tongues as a constant occult innate spell. Paralyzing Claws (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. The target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. Use the moderate DC for the creature's level on the Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus table.","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311","weakness":{},"description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Book of the Dead](/Sources.aspx?ID=118) pg. 160\n\nVetalarana vampires feed on the emotions, thoughts, and memories of others.

7 8-14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 basic vetalarana abilities all vetalaranas gain the following abilities. if the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from being a living creature, it loses them. it also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. you might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vetalarana's theme. thoughtsense (divination, mental, occult) the vetalarana senses all non-mindless creatures within 100 feet as a precise sense. negative healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep vetalarana vulnerabilities all vetalaranas possess the following weaknesses. barred senses a vetalarana can't see or sense through force effects or cold iron, and their mind can't penetrate force effects or cold iron. such barriers can prevent the transference of a vetalarana's mind through mental rebirth. revulsion a vetalarana delights in consuming memories and secrets, and is disgusted by those who share such sensitive tidbits openly. a vetalarana can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a creature loudly voicing their intimate personal secrets or most cherished memories aloud. speaking such information aloud with conviction is a single action that has the auditory, concentrate, and linguistic traits, and protects the creature until the start of its next turn. a vetalarana that involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a creature sharing such information gains the fleeing condition until they're 10 feet or farther from the creature. after 1 round of being exposed to the secrets of a creature, a vetalarana can attempt a dc 25 will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. on a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). vulnerable to brain destruction a vetalarana whose brain has been destroyed, or is reduced to 0 hp while unable to take mental actions, can't use mental rebirth. mental rebirth (curse, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult) unlike most other undead, a vetalarana isn't destroyed when they reach 0 hp. instead, their body is destroyed, crumbling to ash, and their mind is immediately transferred into a creature they rendered comatose through drain thoughts. this creature must be within 1 mile; if no such creature is in range, the vetalarana is destroyed. the creature becomes controlled by the vetalarana and loses the stupefied and unconscious conditions. if the creature controlled by a vetalarana in this way is killed, the vetalarana's mind transfers to another creature within 1 mile who they rendered comatose through drain thoughts. after 1d6 days of being controlled, the controlled creature dies, and its body transforms into that of the vetalarana who rendered it comatose. climb speed a vetalarana gains a climb speed equal to their land speed. claws if the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw strike that deals slashing damage, has the agile trait, and can grab. use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the strike damage table. drain thoughts single action (divination, mental, occult) requirements a grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vetalarana's reach; effect the vetalarana seizes a creature and consumes its memories. this requires an athletics check against the victim's fortitude dc if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. the victim is stupefied 1, and the vetalarana regains hp equal to 10% of the vetalarana's maximum hp, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. draining thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any hp to the vetalarana but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. additionally, the vetalarana views one of the victim's memories. a victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week. a victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose, becoming permanently unconscious. as long as the vetalarana lives, a comatose victim can't regain consciousness, and its stupefied condition doesn't decrease. vetalarana manipulator abilities extremely powerful vetalaranas who've tasted the thoughts of hundreds of people or more become empowered by the memories and experiences they've consumed, overcoming their revulsions. they gain greater control over their comatose victims, can manipulate memories, and even paralyze with a touch. these vetalaranas are known as “manipulators,” although those with psychic powers of their own often prefer the terms “doyen” or “thoughtseer.” vetalarana manipulators gain additional abilities, as detailed below. a creature below 10th level isn't powerful enough to become a vetalarana manipulator; instead, make such a creature into a regular vetalarana or rebuild the creature so that it's at least 10th level before making it a vetalarana manipulator. resistances the vetalarana manipulator resists mental damage and all physical damage (except magical cold iron). control comatose (exploration, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, occult, possession) frequency once per day; effect the vetalarana manipulator spends 10 minutes to take psychic control of the creatures they've rendered comatose with drain thoughts. this has the effects of the possession spell, but lasts for up to 6 hours, has a range of 1 mile, and the vetalarana can control a number of comatose victims at a time equal to half the vetalarana's level. a comatose victim can't resist this possession and automatically gets a critical failure on its saving throw against control comatose. as long as a comatose victim is controlled by a vetalarana manipulator in this way, the victim's stupefied and unconscious conditions are temporarily suppressed. drain thoughts single action (divination, mental, occult) as a basic vetalarana, but the vetalarana manipulator can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory they view as a 4th-level modify memory spell. if the vetalarana gets a critical success on their athletics check to drain thoughts, the target is stupefied 2 instead of stupefied 1. occult innate spells a vetalarana manipulator has tongues as a constant occult innate spell. paralyzing claws (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) any living creature hit by a vetalarana manipulator's claw strike must succeed at a fortitude save or become paralyzed. the target can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns to end the effect, and the dc cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save. use the moderate dc for the creature's level on the spell dc and spell attack bonus table.","features":null},{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Vampire,

It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Swift Tracker** The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while [Tracking](/Actions.aspx?ID=66). \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) \n\n**Feral Corruption** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Trigger** The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9) is within 100 feet; **Effect** Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020)). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be [counteracted](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with magic (though [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) works against it normally).\n\n If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.\n\n A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. \n\n**Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities** Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Burial Site Bound** A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. </li><li>**Vulnerable to Decapitation** A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Fangs** The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. \n\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.\n\n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. \n\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.\n\n \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Vrykolakas Master Abilities</title> Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. \n\n**Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including [rat swarms](/Monsters.aspx?ID=347), [warg](/Monsters.aspx?ID=402), [werewolves](/Monsters.aspx?ID=411), and similar creatures.

Such vrykolakas spawn are generally [friendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=18) to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. **Dominate Animal** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [enchantment](/Traits.aspx?ID=61), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) The vrykolakas can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=87) at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a –4 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. \n\n**Drink Blood** As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.","name":"Vampire, Vrykolakas","primary_source":"Bestiary 2","primary_source_raw":"Bestiary 2 pg. 275","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2020-05-27","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"source":["Bestiary 2"],"source_raw":["Bestiary 2 pg. 275"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Bestiary 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=32) pg. 275 <sup>2.0</sup>","speed":{},"summary":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","summary_markdown":"Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses. …","text":" Vampire, Vrykolakas Source Bestiary 2 pg. 275 2.0 Wicked and vengeful souls denied even the most basic burial rites can rise again as vrykolakas, blood-drinking and plague-bearing reanimated corpses.

Vrykolakas Habits Most vrykolakas have curious affectations, such as a compulsion to knock on a door before entering or calling out the name of the person within. If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a moroi vampire, however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions. Vampire Related Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana Creating a Vrykolakas You can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and it becomes evil. Increase AC, attack modifiers, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase Speed by 10 feet or to 40 feet, whichever results in a higher Speed. Increase damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead. Basic Vrykolakas Abilities If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. Darkvision Swift Tracker The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking. Negative Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Feral Corruption Free Action (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though remove curse works against it normally). If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed. A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. Burial Site Bound A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas. Climb Speed A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. Claws If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Fangs The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. Drink Blood Single Action (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. Rend Single Action The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws. Vrykolakas Master Abilities Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below. Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient. Children of the Night (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, warg, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Pestilential Aura (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague. Divine Innate Spells The vrykolakas master can cast vampiric touch (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells.

Their spines are bent in a perpetual hunch. While some vrykolakas can cloak themselves in a semblance of living flesh, their fragmented memories often cannot accurately recreate their former appearance or persona.

These revenants appear as humans come back after death to complete some task left undone before they can peacefully rest. Many are vengeful and murderous, but some are simply attempting to return to their former lives, like a shoemaker rising from the grave to mend his children's shoes, carry water, and chop firewood. The Pathfinder version of this creature is more associated with a feral form of vampire.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Vrykolakas Habits</title>\r\n\r\nMost vrykolakas have curious affectations, such as a compulsion to knock on a door before entering or calling out the name of the person within. If the person answers, the vrykolakas then tries to hunt and slay them within 3 days. Others have an affinity for specific types of animals, always preferring to charm or possess them, or have an aversion to others. Unlike a [moroi vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), however, for a vrykolakas these habits are merely sadistic games or personal preferences, not mystical compulsions.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"Creature Family Group\">Vampire</title>\r\n\r\n**Related Families**\r\n[Vampire](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=97), [Vampire, Jiang-Shi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=286), [Vampire, Nosferatu](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=273), [Vampire, Strigoi](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=314), [Vampire, Vetalarana](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=311)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Vrykolakas</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing living creature into a vrykolakas using the following steps.

If an ability can be used only a small number of times (such as a dragon's Breath Weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li></ul> \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Basic Vrykolakas Abilities</title> If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=90) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=91). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**Swift Tracker** The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while [Tracking](/Actions.aspx?ID=66). \n\n**[Negative Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)** \n\n**Immunities** [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=40) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=46), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=145) \n\n**Feral Corruption** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> ([curse](/Traits.aspx?ID=38), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117), [possession](/Traits.aspx?ID=129)) **Trigger** The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an [animal](/Traits.aspx?ID=9) is within 100 feet; **Effect** Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the [Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table](/Rules.aspx?ID=1020)). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the [_possession_](/Spells.aspx?ID=225) spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be [counteracted](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) with magic (though [_remove curse_](/Spells.aspx?ID=250) works against it normally).\n\n If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.\n\n A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=28), and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. \n\n**Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities** Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Burial Site Bound** A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. </li><li>**Vulnerable to Decapitation** A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li></ul>**Climb Speed** A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. \n\n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=170) trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the [Strike Damage](/Rules.aspx?ID=1018) table. \n\n**Fangs** The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. \n\n**Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=48), [necromancy](/Traits.aspx?ID=117)) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=3) check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=10), and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.\n\n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 [Medicine](/Skills.aspx?ID=9) check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. \n\n**[Rend](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=30)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.\n\n \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Vrykolakas Master Abilities</title> Particularly powerful vrykolakas can create spawn from the bodies of their victims and gain additional abilities, as detailed below.

Along the way, these acrid wasps devour everything in sight. Not even the ground itself is spared from their appetite. While any single vescavor is no problem, they travel in swarms to overwhelm anything trying to stop them. In a truly unfortunate situation, several swarms will be gathered and led by a vescavor queen. These queens, while fearsome on their own, can drive their brood into a feeding rage unlike any other. Swarms found without a queen are directionless, destroying anything around them indiscriminately. Whenever a vescavor swarm is not eating, it gibbers mind-numbing songs from the fiends' dark world. Adapted to the shrieking jungles of their home plane, they issue a call that confuses and corrupts mortals.\n\n Philosophers who ponder the [Outer Rifts](/Planes.aspx?ID=45) often conjecture as to what kind of soul forms a vescavor.

thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage. a visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. visitants’ bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips. whip scars from their hours of “training” glow with an unnatural purple light. and perhaps above all, their eyes mark them as touched by undeath—sunken horribly deep into their skull, leaking blood or other fluid, and glowing with an aura of dread and palpable anger. visitant abilities you can modify visitants by applying the following abilities. most visitants have one of these abilities, but more powerful visitants might have more, in which you might consider increasing the visitant’s level and statistics. noxious breath two actions the visitant exhales sharply, releasing pungent fumes from its lungs in a 15-foot cone. each creature in the area must succeed at a fortitude save or become sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure). roar single action (auditory, concentrate, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, primal) the visitant lets out a loud and horrifying roar. each creature within 100 feet must attempt at a will save. no matter the result, affected creatures are then temporarily immune to the effect for 1 minute. critical success the creature is unaffected. success the creature is frightened 1. failure the creature is frightened 2. critical failure the creature is frightened 3. vengeful presence (aura, emotion, enchantment, mental) 20 feet. a creature that starts its turn within the visitant’s aura must succeed at a will save or be overcome with a thirst for vengeance. for 1d4 rounds (1 minute on a critical failure), if the affected creature was attacked within the last round (whether or not the attack hit), the creature must use at least 1 action per round to strike or use a hostile action toward its last attacker as long as the attacker is still alive. failure to do so deals the affected creature 1d6 mental damage, plus 1d6 for every 5 levels the visitant has. wrestle single action the visitant makes a claw strike against a creature it has grabbed. if the attack hits, that creature is knocked prone. members chimpanzee visitant (creature 3), lion visitant (creature 5) creating visitants to create a visitant animal, use one of the stat blocks on this page as a starting point. adjust the size as necessary and give its strikes reach if it’s huge or larger. visitants can also be made using a zombie stat block as a base;

saving throw fortitude dc is the moderate spell dc for the werecreature's new level. on each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. the creature is under the gm's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn. moon frenzy (polymorph, primal) when a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't change shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. when the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.","features":null},{"category":"creature-family","creature_family":"Werecreature, Wereant","creature_family_markdown":"Werecreature, Wereant","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"creature-family-302","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Werecreature, Wereant](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=302)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Pathfinder #174: Shadows of the Ancients](/Sources.aspx?ID=115) pg. 86\n\nInsectile werecreatures, such as wereants, only come about in unusual circumstances, such as powerful curses from inhuman gods or transformative magic run amok.

Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt—the term “wild hunt” refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry. Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.\n\n While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Wild Hunt Archer](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2214) (Creature 16), [Wild Hunt Horse](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2213) (Creature 15), [Wild Hunt Hound](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2212) (Creature 14), [Wild Hunt Monarch](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2216) (Creature 20), [Wild Hunt Scout](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2215) (Creature 18)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Erastil</title>\r\n\r\nThose who lack understanding or religious backgrounds sometimes mistake representations of the wild hunt as depictions of the god [Erastil](/Deities.aspx?ID=6), but Erastil and his church have long fought against the capricious, often destructive effects the wild hunt can have on rural societies. Some believe that Erastil was the first Horned Lord in an ancient time, and that his heart and conscience caused him to step away from the role, leaving behind a son to take up that position; these beliefs are regarded as blasphemy by the church itself. Certainly, those who claim to worship Erastil in this light do not count any actual clerics among their number.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Other Wild Hunts</title>\r\n\r\nThe agents of the wild hunt presented here represent typical wild hunts, but rumors persist of other, much rarer fey of the wild hunt. Stories of shapeshifting wild hunt infiltrators, wild hunt trappers capable of transforming the terrain into hazards, and wild hunt warlords who stand taller than any other member of the wild hunt persist on certain remote worlds.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Serving The Eldest</title>\r\n\r\nSome wild hunt bands serve specific members among [the Eldest](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=7). These variant wild hunts always have the same abilities and statistics as those presented on these pages, but often bear minor physical changes to set them apart. For example, wild hunts that serve [the Lantern King](/Deities.aspx?ID=95) have eyes that shine with fiery light, as if a flickering lantern flame burned deep within their skulls.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Surviving The Hunt</title>\r\n\r\nWhen one is marked by the wild hunt, there is often little that can be done to avoid their attention. Some stories give examples of fraught chases in which a hunted prey escapes the wild hunt through evasion and luck. The best way to simulate such an encounter is to use the [chase](/Rules.aspx?ID=1210) rules. If you do so, it should be a long chase with DCs appropriately high to challenge PCs of 15th or higher level—the wild hunt is not intended to be a challenge that lower level PCs can hope to survive against, after all!\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">The Horned King</title>\r\n\r\nAll fey of the wild hunt ultimately serve a legendary leader they refer to only as the Horned King. The Horned King's true nature is unknown, but its ability to command such powerful followers suggests that it is a fey on par with one of [the Eldest](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=7) (who themselves deny knowledge of such a creature's existence). The Horned King does not grant spells to clerics. When the Horned King calls, several wild hunts join into a legion and ride together against legendary opponents.

Countless members of these fey compose the wild hunt—the term “wild hunt” refers to the family of creatures as a whole as well as to individual groups of these fey who gather to pursue their quarry. Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but their hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back their forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover. While most missions come from rumors gathered by a wild hunt monarch, monarchs occasionally consider proposals from the few who are brave and knowledgeable enough to seek them out. They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth. Wild hunt monarchs take grave offense at unfavorable deals. Those who attempt to cheat a monarch often become the enraged fey's next target. Members Wild Hunt Archer (Creature 16), Wild Hunt Horse (Creature 15), Wild Hunt Hound (Creature 14), Wild Hunt Monarch (Creature 20), Wild Hunt Scout (Creature 18) Erastil Those who lack understanding or religious backgrounds sometimes mistake representations of the wild hunt as depictions of the god Erastil, but Erastil and his church have long fought against the capricious, often destructive effects the wild hunt can have on rural societies. Some believe that Erastil was the first Horned Lord in an ancient time, and that his heart and conscience caused him to step away from the role, leaving behind a son to take up that position; these beliefs are regarded as blasphemy by the church itself. Certainly, those who claim to worship Erastil in this light do not count any actual clerics among their number. Other Wild Hunts The agents of the wild hunt presented here represent typical wild hunts, but rumors persist of other, much rarer fey of the wild hunt. Stories of shapeshifting wild hunt infiltrators, wild hunt trappers capable of transforming the terrain into hazards, and wild hunt warlords who stand taller than any other member of the wild hunt persist on certain remote worlds. Serving The Eldest Some wild hunt bands serve specific members among the Eldest. These variant wild hunts always have the same abilities and statistics as those presented on these pages, but often bear minor physical changes to set them apart. For example, wild hunts that serve the Lantern King have eyes that shine with fiery light, as if a flickering lantern flame burned deep within their skulls. Surviving The Hunt When one is marked by the wild hunt, there is often little that can be done to avoid their attention. Some stories give examples of fraught chases in which a hunted prey escapes the wild hunt through evasion and luck. The best way to simulate such an encounter is to use the chase rules. If you do so, it should be a long chase with DCs appropriately high to challenge PCs of 15th or higher level—the wild hunt is not intended to be a challenge that lower level PCs can hope to survive against, after all! The Horned King All fey of the wild hunt ultimately serve a legendary leader they refer to only as the Horned King. The Horned King's true nature is unknown, but its ability to command such powerful followers suggests that it is a fey on par with one of the Eldest (who themselves deny knowledge of such a creature's existence). The Horned King does not grant spells to clerics. When the Horned King calls, several wild hunts join into a legion and ride together against legendary opponents. This call is rare, however, and wild hunts are normally left to direct themselves or to serve other entities, such as the Lantern King.

The decaying body fattens and instructs the very worms that feast upon it. These grave worms thrive not only on the consumption of the spellcaster’s dead flesh, but on their corrupt memories and magical power. The spellcaster’s very soul is consumed in this vile process, only to be split apart into fragments that inhabit each of the individual worms. The result is a hideous hive mind of slithering life known as a worm that walks—a mass of worms that clings to the vague shape of the body that granted it this new existence and can use the powers and magic the spellcaster had in life. A worm that walks retains memories of its life as a spellcaster before its death, but it is not undead—it is a hideous new form of undulant life.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Worm That Walks Cultist](/Monsters.aspx?ID=864) (Creature 14)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Other Walking Vermin</title>\r\n\r\nWhile worms are the most common type of creature to form the composite body of a worm that walks, other verminous variations are possible. \n<ul><li>**Cockroaches**: A worm that walks made of cockroaches gains a +1 bonus to AC and [light blindness](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=22).</li><li>**Leeches**: A worm that walks made of leeches gains a swim Speed of 25 feet, but its land Speed is 10 feet.</li><li>**Spiders**: A worm that walks made of spiders gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed, and half the damage from its Squirming Embrace is poison damage.</li></ul>\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Worms Redeemed</title>\r\n\r\nIn rare situations, once a spellcaster rises as a worm that walks it might recant its evil ways, given the right influence and enough time. Many of these worms that walk seek self-destruction, not out of abhorrence at their new form but at the realization of the evils they wrought while alive. Others, though, take advantage of their second chance and use their new life to help undo the ruin and horror they might have afflicted upon the world in their prior existence.\r\n</aside>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Creating a Worm That Walks</title>\r\n\r\nYou can turn an existing evil, living, spellcasting creature into a worm that walks using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n<ul><li>It gains the aberration and swarm traits and usually remains evil. </li><li>Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. </li><li>Reduce its Hit Points by the amount listed on the table (to a minimum of 2 HP per level). </li><li>The worm that walks gains fast healing, resistance to physical damage, and weakness to area damage and splash damage as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the worm that walks has fewer HP.</li></ul>\n\n## Worm That Walks\n<row gap=\"tiny\">\n<table> <tr><td>**Starting Level**</td><td>**HP Decrease**</td><td>**Fast Healing, Resistance, and Weakness**</td></tr> <tr><td>4 or less</td><td>-20</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>5-7</td><td>-30</td><td>7</td></tr> <tr><td>8-14</td><td>-40</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>15 or higher</td><td>-60</td><td>15</td></tr> </table>\r\n</row> \n\n### Worm That Walks Abilities\n A worm that walks loses any abilities that came from its previous physical form and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conflict with the monster’s new theme as a worm that walks. \n\n**[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)** \n\n**[Tremorsense](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=40)** 30 feet (imprecise) \n\n**Immunities** All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, and unconscious. They also have the [swarm mind](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=36) ability, which makes them immune to [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) effects that target a specific number of creatures, though they are still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area. \n\n**[All-Around Vision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=1)** \n\n**Discorporate** When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.\n\n While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks’s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or [splash](/Traits.aspx?ID=150) weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check.

Members Worm That Walks Cultist (Creature 14) Other Walking Vermin While worms are the most common type of creature to form the composite body of a worm that walks, other verminous variations are possible. Cockroaches : A worm that walks made of cockroaches gains a +1 bonus to AC and light blindness. Leeches : A worm that walks made of leeches gains a swim Speed of 25 feet, but its land Speed is 10 feet. Spiders : A worm that walks made of spiders gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed, and half the damage from its Squirming Embrace is poison damage. Worms Redeemed In rare situations, once a spellcaster rises as a worm that walks it might recant its evil ways, given the right influence and enough time. Many of these worms that walk seek self-destruction, not out of abhorrence at their new form but at the realization of the evils they wrought while alive. Others, though, take advantage of their second chance and use their new life to help undo the ruin and horror they might have afflicted upon the world in their prior existence. Creating a Worm That Walks You can turn an existing evil, living, spellcasting creature into a worm that walks using the following steps. Increase the creature’s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the aberration and swarm traits and usually remains evil. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Reduce its Hit Points by the amount listed on the table (to a minimum of 2 HP per level). The worm that walks gains fast healing, resistance to physical damage, and weakness to area damage and splash damage as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the worm that walks has fewer HP. ## Worm That Walks Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing, Resistance, and Weakness 4 or less -20 5 5-7 -30 7 8-14 -40 10 15 or higher -60 15 ### Worm That Walks Abilities A worm that walks loses any abilities that came from its previous physical form and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid. It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conflict with the monster’s new theme as a worm that walks. Darkvision Tremorsense 30 feet (imprecise) Immunities All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, and unconscious. They also have the swarm mind ability, which makes them immune to mental effects that target a specific number of creatures, though they are still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area. All-Around Vision Discorporate When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days. While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks’s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or splash weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM’s discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks. Tendril Regardless of the creature’s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with reach that deals persistent piercing damage as it leaves biting worms on the target. If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should deal three-quarters of that damage. Squirming Embrace Single Action The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a basic Reflex save with a DC of the worm that walks’s spell DC – 2. Swarm Shape Single Action (concentrate) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While discorporated, the worm that walks can’t use attack actions and can’t cast spells, but it can move through areas small enough for its individual worms to fit without having to Squeeze.
