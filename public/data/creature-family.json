Azatas are passionate and mercurial, as beautiful and bright as a child's fantasy, but also fiercely loyal to those they hold dear.

This latter characteristic leads many individual amurruns into trouble, yet this inquisitiveness is paired with a penchant for good fortune that offsets much of their self-induced peril. They accept the term “catfolk” as a name for their people with grace and a hint of amusement. Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone amurrun can be found anywhere in the world, but it's rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many an amurrun might say, “I've lived with my people my whole life, but you? You're new and different! There's so much to learn from you!”\n\n Longstanding amurrun legends claim the catfolk were first created as guardians and were then charged with protecting the world from those sinister forces that exist at its fringes.

Characters might make use of a corrupt judge to keep a target of their investigations in town while they go about their business or hire a master of disguise to infiltrate a building and map a floor plan before pulling a job. All it takes is coin and a quiet word in the right ear. Criminal Scams Common criminal scams include fake collectors for nonexistent charities for the diseased and downtrodden, rigged games of chance at local fairs offering worthless prizes, flashy street performers concealing the work of pickpockets in the audience, and plants who offer to help travelers find accommodations but lead them to inns with exorbitant prices. Crossover Ancestry NPCs Several of the NPCs elsewhere in NPC Core can fit well in this group: Gnome daredevil (level 2), halfling smuggler (level 6), leaping thief (level 3) Fantasy Crimes While many crimes in Pathfinder are similar to crimes in the real world, certain crimes are possible only in a world of magic. These include using magic to win a wager, malicious uses of curses, violating autonomy with spells that charm or control others, falsifying fortunes, violating privacy with scrying, or trespassing via teleportation. Folk Heroes Real-world bandits exist in folklore and history as champions of the downtrodden, fighting against their oppressors, robbing the rich, and striking at the powerful from secret dens deep in the wilderness. The gang leader could well be a local legend, someone who the PCs can turn to for mutual aid when the going gets tough. More Scams Fraudsters sell fake alchemical items, medicines, charms, talismans, or other minor magics. Unscrupulous moneylenders take advantage of lax business regulations to employ predatory repayment terms. Phony fortune-tellers and mediums use cold-reading techniques to lull gullible marks. Protection Rackets Criminal organizations often find it easier to demand protection money from locals than go to the trouble of stealing it. “Protection” includes an implicit assumption that those who pay up are safe from those criminals, and some groups also promise retribution should those who pay them fall afoul of other criminals. Sanctuary Adventurers or those they rescue might be able to find sanctuary in sacred places to buy time against pursuers or disappear from those hunting them. These institutions range from simple rural shrines to monasteries to larger estates. The churches of Asmodeus, Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, Irori, Sarenrae, and Shelyn are the most likely to grant sanctuary—though some of these ask much in exchange for their protections. Walking The Walk Traveling devotees, such as the pilgrim and traveling priest, are both well-traveled and more than willing to speak to new people. This makes these voyagers a trove of rumors, stories of fabled lands, and wise words for those most in need. Yet, they're also far from home, so their reliance on the largesse of others means they're frequently willing to trade information, travel alongside others, share lodgings, or find other beneficial arrangements.

Redemption Through Penance Gods have many demands, and even the devoted can fail to meet them. It is important to understand what might cause one to lose a connection with their deity and what steps are necessary to atone and regain their place among the devoted, as these vary widely between deities. Though the penitent is the most likely to have fallen from their faith, many of these NPCs could have their divine abilities removed to appear as fallen or excommunicated characters.

Diabolic dragons, these scholars argue, are just extensions of the plane, living creatures that break off from Hell to enact its will. Whether this is true or whether diabolical dragons are simply the reborn souls of dragons sent to Hell, the fact remains that these dragons are powerful, cunning, and tyrannical.

The dragon has great latitude to freely march Hell's armies where needed, but in recent centuries, she's found delight in leaving Hell to tempt great mortal warriors with countless promises. Those who give in find themselves conscripted into the armies of Hell when they inevitably meet their demise at the hands of a similarly empowered rival on the battlefield. Azhadar's most recent appearance was near Bloodcove, where she made an offer to a tyrannical pirate captain.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Diabolic Dragon Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nA diabolical dragon's lair is a surprisingly sparse place. Most of these dragons find caverns or large rooms within Hell to claim as their lair but keep relatively little within.

They constantly use these magical energies to empower their magical abilities and even their bodies, as the energy can heal wounds. A fortune dragon has a typical build for an arcane dragon, but their bodies sport a striking feature: their treasure. The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process. Fortune dragons are seekers of novel experiences. This desire for originality leads fortune dragons to approach visitors of other ancestries with curiosity, though this initial interest quickly wanes if a visitor lacks exciting qualities.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Adult Fortune Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2945) (Creature 14), [Ancient Fortune Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2946) (Creature 19), [Young Fortune Dragon](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2944) (Creature 10)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Fortune Dragon Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nA fortune dragon's lair typically holds a much larger hoard than other dragons collect.

Fortune dragons are particularly protective of their rarest treasures and will either bury them deep within their hoard or keep them directly attached to their bodies, where the treasure is safest.

They constantly use these magical energies to empower their magical abilities and even their bodies, as the energy can heal wounds. A fortune dragon has a typical build for an arcane dragon, but their bodies sport a striking feature: their treasure. The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process. Fortune dragons are seekers of novel experiences.

Unlike the hoards of other dragons, a mirage dragon takes care to polish every coin, gem, and precious metal to a mirror shine. These reflective items are placed methodically throughout the lair, allowing the dragon to see themself from all angles at any time.

While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties— small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.\n\n Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thick- scaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.\n\n Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Drake Eggs</title> While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.\n\n A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.\n\n A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.\n\n Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.\n\n It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Desert Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2963) (Creature 8), [Flame Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2959) (Creature 5), [Frost Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2962) (Creature 7), [Jungle Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2960) (Creature 6), [River Drake](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2958) (Creature 3), [Wyvern](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2961) (Creature 6)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Drake Hunters</title>\r\n\r\nThe allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril.

Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, they might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Drake Treasure</title>\r\n\r\nDrakes share dragons' interest in treasure but lack their discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\">Other Drakes</title>\r\n\r\nThe drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit poisonous clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands.

While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties— small social groups fittingly called “rampages”—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders. Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thick- scaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed. Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them. Drake Eggs While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians. A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely. A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg. Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it. It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges. Members Desert Drake (Creature 8), Flame Drake (Creature 5), Frost Drake (Creature 7), Jungle Drake (Creature 6), River Drake (Creature 3), Wyvern (Creature 6) Drake Hunters The allure of hunting a dragon is difficult to resist for many adventurers, but accomplishing such a task is fraught with peril. Unscrupulous adventurers have been known to instead hunt drakes and use trophies harvested from these creatures to deceive locals. Drake Resources While every adventurer knows that dragon hide can be crafted into potent armor or weapons, drake hide holds no such intrinsic value. Nonetheless, drake scales and horns are physically impressive, and to the uneducated buyer, they might seem at first glance to be legitimate. Unscrupulous leatherworkers have been known to use drake hides to craft and sell counterfeit dragonhide armor, so potential buyers should remain on the lookout for scams. Drake Treasure Drakes share dragons' interest in treasure but lack their discerning taste. A drake hoard will certainly contain coins, jewelry, gemstones, gear, and even the odd magic item or two, but the bulk of the hoard invariably consists of broken weapons, shiny rocks, bits of junk, and other doubtful pieces of refuse. Other Drakes The drakes presented on these pages are far from the only types that exist. Forest drakes have green hides, spit poisonous clouds, and can be found in temperate woodlands. Rift drakes, among the most powerful of their kind, spit clinging caustic vapors and dwell in badlands and regions scarred by devastating magical disasters. Sea drakes can be found in oceans across the world, lava drakes in volcanic crevasses, mist drakes along coastlines and in salt marshes, and spire drakes in ragged, rocky hills.

Engineering Device Malfunctions When making an attack or activating an ability granted by a mechanical device that has been poorly maintained or is of shoddy construction, an engineer must attempt a DC 5 flat check after making the relevant attack roll or skill check. On a failure, the action is lost and the device misfires spectacularly (roll on the Device Malfunctions table). A device misfire doesn't affect the amount of time that must pass before some abilities can be used again. ## Device Malfunctions d6 Effect 1 Fizzle The device jams or short-circuits. If the triggering action was an attack, it retroactively becomes a critical failure. The engineer must use an Interact action to reset the device before it can be used again. 2 Backfire The device violently explodes, disabling it and dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels the engineer has in a 5-foot burst centered on the device. The device is broken until the engineer Repairs it. 3 Off-Target If the triggering action was a targeted attack, the attack instead targets another creature (other than the engineer) within 10 feet of the intended target, determined randomly by the GM. If no such target exists, the attack misses. 4 System Reset A burst of feedback momentarily shuts down all the engineer's devices. The engineer can't use attacks or abilities granted by any personal engineering device, potentially including movement speeds, until the start of their next turn. 5 Overheat The overstressed device generates a wave of intense heat. The device burns the engineer for 4d6 fire damage and 2d4 persistent fire damage, with a basic Reflex save. The DC is equal to the engineer's Fortitude DC. The engineer can Release the item before rolling to improve their degree of success on the save by one step. 6 Delayed Reaction The device fails to function, having no apparent effect. At the start of the engineer's next turn, the device automatically activates. The GM chooses any target or area at random.

She's often invoked when an inventor needs inspiration or is on the clock and needs the next few hours to go slower. Often, engineers engrave small icons of Brigh's religious symbol—a mask in her likeness. Crossover Ancestry NPCs Several of the NPCs elsewhere in NPC Core can fit well in this group: Goblin scavenger (level 4), kobold trapper (level 2) Firearms Multiple engineers use firearms, technology that's present in relatively small numbers on Golarion. These are uncommon, simple, and martial weapons, so many player characters can use them. If you want to avoid putting the items in their hands, swap out the firearms with crossbow or similar weapons. More firearms and the gunslinger class appear in Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears . Gadgets For PCs Since engineers often carry unique gadgets, your player characters will likely want to salvage and reuse those items. If you want to do this in your games, you can either let them use the items primarily as written or convert them into consumable gadgets. In any case, these items are typically unstable when salvaged, usable once to a few times or subject to misfires. Mechanical Allies Often, engineers are accompanied by mechanical creatures of their own creation, like clockwork hounds or mechanical birds.

You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities.\n\n [**Darkvision**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=12)<br /> **Site Bound** A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. <br />**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.<br /> **[Void Healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=42)**<br /> **Immunities** bleed, [death](/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), precision, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95) Resistances all damage 5 (except [force](/Traits.aspx?ID=610), [_ghost touch_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840), [spirit](/Traits.aspx?ID=737), or [vitality](/Traits.aspx?ID=509); double resistance to non-[magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=644)). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. <br />**Fly Speed** equal to its Speed<br /> **Ghostly Hand** All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage. It typically has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526), [finesse](/Traits.aspx?ID=602), and [magical](/Traits.aspx?ID=644) traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Special Abilities</title> Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes. For DCs, use the high spell DC of the [ghost's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899).\n\n **Corrupting Gaze**<actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage plus 1d6 for every 2 levels the ghost has with a [basic](/Rules.aspx?ID=329) Will save. A creature that fails its save is also [stupefied 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=94) for 1 minute.<br /> **Draining Touch** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level.<br /> **Frightful Moan** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=541), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=598), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes [frightened 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=76) (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.<br /> **Inhabit Object** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an [animated object](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=4). This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature,  the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it.

Members Ghost Commoner (Creature 4), Ghost Mage (Creature 10) Creating a Ghost You can also use the following guidelines to turn living creatures into ghosts. Increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and increase all other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level. Ghost Abilities A ghost gains the ghost, incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become unholy. The base creature loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid, and any abilities or traits that rely on it being a living, corporeal creature. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. Darkvision Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. Rejuvenation (divine) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Void Healing Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch , spirit, or vitality; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. Fly Speed equal to its Speed Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. Special Abilities Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes. For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level. Corrupting Gaze Two Actions The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage plus 1d6 for every 2 levels the ghost has with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Draining Touch Two Actions With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level. Frightful Moan Single Action (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute. Inhabit Object Single Action The ghost possesses an object of size Large or smaller within 20 feet, making it an animated object. This animated object's level can be no higher than the ghost's level – 2. If the target object is being held by a creature, the bearer can attempt a Will save to prevent the possession. This possession ends when the object is destroyed or the ghost leaves it. At this point, the ghost reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. Malevolent Possession Two Actions The ghost attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature. This has the same effect as the possession spell, except since the ghost doesn't have a physical body, it is unaffected by that restriction of the spell. Telekinetic Assault Two Actions (divine) The ghost cries out in pain and anguish as small objects and debris fly about in a 30-foot emanation.

Giants of many types reside in the Saga Lands, where their ancestors were forced to serve ancient Thassilon, and in the Mindspin Mountains. Giant Pets As with many people, giants enjoy keeping pets. Large animals like bears and lions, megafauna like woolly mammoths, and dinosaurs are popular among many giants. Rune giants come closest to breaking this pattern, preferring to tend to their controlled giants, but esoteric types of giants often find equally curious pets. Other Giants Beyond the giants detailed here, many others dwell in remote regions of the world. Wood giants are peaceful guardians of the forests, cave giants lurk alone as vicious predators, and mountain giants are horrific butchers even other giants fear. Oversized Themes Giants are larger-than-life foes. While many giants have themes that tie them to elemental or magical forces, the primary theme giants share is that they embody a classic cultural trope as their basis. Fire giants, for example, can be seen as oversized smiths, and frost giants should evoke the theme of an oversized Viking warrior.

adjustments most military engagements take place in large areas, such as plains or cities, where there is the most territory or resources to be gained. however, guerrilla units fight in forests, swamps, and other tough locations, where they set up traps, ambushes, and use other surprise tactics. you can use these adjustments to turn a military npc or troop into a guerrilla. these can also be useful for mercenaries or other non-military npcs. give the creature a stealth modifier equal to the high skill value for its level. if you're in a hurry, use the creature's highest skill modifier. if the creature has the athletics skill, reduce its modifier by 2. reduce the damage of the creature's strikes by 2, but give it the sneak attack ability. sneak attack the creature deals 1d6 extra precision damage to off-guard creatures. add the pounce ability. pounce single action the creature strides and makes a strike at the end of that movement. if the creature began this action hidden, they remain hidden until after this ability's strike. troop formations battle can be a complicated affair. different situations call for varied arrangement of soldiers. you can add the change formation ability to a troop to give it more options, typically choosing two or three of the possible formations listed here. troops with animal intelligence (–4 or lower) or that aren't battle trained are typically unable to change formation without an outside force commanding them. change formation two actions (concentrate, move) the troop reconfigures to assume one of the formations below they know. using this action again ends any previous formation, and the troop can also use this action to revert to its default formation, ending any benefits and drawbacks. loose members of the troop fan out to cover more ground. benefit any weaknesses the troop has to area and splash damage are suppressed. drawback enemies' saving throws against the troop's damaging effects are one degree of success better than they roll. marching column this formation traverses long distances more rapidly. benefit the troop gains a +10 foot circumstance bonus to all its speeds. drawback the troop is off-guard and takes a –2 penalty to reflex saves. turtle shell the troop interlocks their shields. only a group with shields can use this formation. benefit the troop gains a +2 circumstance bonus to ac against ranged attacks and to reflex saves. drawback the troop takes a –10-foot penalty to all its speeds. wedge the troop aligns itself behind a powerful commander. benefit the troop chooses an adjacent allied creature without the troop trait to fall in behind. each time the chosen creature strides, the troop follows as a free action, striding to keep the chosen creature adjacent. drawback the troop loses some of their autonomy. they're slowed 1 and can't voluntarily move away from their leader. members combat engineer (creature 1), conscript squad (creature 3), drill sergeant (creature

cultures see war differently. some see it as a game to be won, some as an art, and still others as the ultimate form of glory. these different perspectives can be reflected in the names used to describe military units and formations. some militaries go to elaborate lengths to mislead their foes by bestowing ever-changing code names on various divisions and strategies. others may borrow the names of beautiful animals or simply name units after favored weapons. mounted warfare individual military npcs who find themselves in open terrain might need to close the distance to their opponents. consider giving an npc like standard bearer or sniper a war horse, or having a drill sergeant or mage knight ride a veteran war horse. signature weapons phalanx formations are classically seen using a spear as their weapon of choice. however, feel free to swap out this weapon for something more appropriate to the local culture. for example, a phalanx comprised of worshippers of gozreh might wield

They often take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features that match their abodes. The most common of their kind are the dryads: spirits who embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, often a single tree or pond. But, in the case of nymph queens, they can watch over whole forests or massive bodies of water.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Nymph Queens</title> Nymph queens are powerful nymphs who rule over entire regions of untouched wilderness, not just single trees or ponds. Every variety of nymph can have a queen. Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Nymph Queen Abilities</title> A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen's ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad's tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph's beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen's original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a [druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=6) of her level.\n\n **Tied to the Land** A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) any spell that would harm the environment (such as the [_blight_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=111) ritual), using her spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.<br /> **Nymph's Beauty** ([aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542), [emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) 30 feet.

If the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br /> **Inspiration** <actions string=\"Three Actions\" /> ([emotion](/Traits.aspx?ID=590), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [primal](/Traits.aspx?ID=676)) The nymph queen inspires a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair, though it can be some other significant object as well. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with her, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37) checks, [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45) checks, and Will saves.<br /> If the nymph grants her token to a [bard](/Classes.aspx?ID=3), and she's the bard's muse, the queen chooses one additional benefit granted by her token: a +1 status bonus to all [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=41) checks, a +2 status bonus to Performance checks when determining the effects of compositions, a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks, or a +2 status bonus to Will saves against [fey](/Traits.aspx?ID=599).\n\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Dryad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3112) (Creature 3), [Dryad Queen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3114) (Creature 13), [Naiad](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3111) (Creature 1), [Naiad Queen](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3113) (Creature 7)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_5_TreasureAndRewards.png\">Artistic Treasures</title>\r\n\r\nNymphs favor art over any other types of material possession, often collecting the finest pieces they can and endeavoring to create their own.

Naiad queens are among the most prominent, and more often interact with nearby mortals. Thus, some scholars refer to naiad queens as simply “nymphs.” Nymph Queen Abilities A nymph queen is 6 to 10 levels higher than an ordinary nymph of the same type, with enhanced numerical statistics and improved Strikes to match. A nymph queen's ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad's tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph's beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen's original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level. Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract any spell that would harm the environment (such as the blight ritual), using her spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-rank druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region. Nymph's Beauty (aura, emotion, mental, primal, visual) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen's entry. Change Shape Single Action (polymorph, primal) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form. Focus Beauty Single Action (emotion, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target, who must attempt a save against her nymph's beauty aura. If the creature fails and was already affected by the aura, it takes a greater effect described in the nymph queen's entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn. Inspiration Three Actions (emotion, mental, primal) The nymph queen inspires a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair, though it can be some other significant object as well. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with her, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves. If the nymph grants her token to a bard, and she's the bard's muse, the queen chooses one additional benefit granted by her token: a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks, a +2 status bonus to Performance checks when determining the effects of compositions, a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks, or a +2 status bonus to Will saves against fey. Members Dryad (Creature 3), Dryad Queen (Creature 13), Naiad (Creature 1), Naiad Queen (Creature 7) Artistic Treasures Nymphs favor art over any other types of material possession, often collecting the finest pieces they can and endeavoring to create their own. Nymphs sometimes carry magical trinkets or wear enchanted clothing or jewelry, but the greatest treasure a nymph queen can share is often her inspiration to those seeking a muse. Harmonious Landscapes Nymphs tend to be closely associated with specific areas of natural splendor and beauty—woodlands for dryads, rivers for naiads. Areas where nymphs dwell always look more pristine, breathtaking, and scenic than they would otherwise. Inspirations for Art Nymphs are living manifestations of beauty and grace, and as such they are often the subjects of art—sculpture and paintings in particular. Promising a nymph to immortalize them in a work of art can be an excellent way to secure that nymph's favor, but one should take care to ensure that the nymph admires and is proud of the artistic effort's final result, lest the nymph be insulted and lash out with her powerful magic. Other Nymphs Naiads and dryads are the most well-known nymphs, but others exist as well. Hesperides, for example, are warders of the sunset and golden light and can be encountered dwelling on coastal cliffsides or remote islands. Lampads, on the other hand, are dark, moody nymphs found in wondrous, crystal-lined caverns deep underground.

Scholarly Titles University scholars can be just as obsessed with titles as the most hidebound aristocracy, and so all the Inner Sea's universities have a wealth of ranks, titles, degrees, and forms of address. A few of the most common are dean, rector, professor, docent, lecturer, reader, fellow, elder, doctor, master, philosopher, tutor, and don, with a host of vice-, deputy-, senior-, and emeritus-variants on all of them. Uncommon Scholastic Disciplines Beside the life and natural sciences such as arcana, biology, botany, geology, oceanography, and zoology, demand is increasing in cities for more modern disciplines like anthropology, economics, sociology, urban planning, and even art curation and forensic investigation.

fail their saves against a wrathspawn's sinful bite are drained 1 as well as enfeebled 1 for 1 minute. members sinspawn (creature 2) born of sin sinspawn retreated from the world for many centuries following the collapse of the runelords' empire, but in recent years they have emerged from ancient dungeons, strange magical pools, and other forgotten ruins. sinspawn cannot procreate, but in certain cases, incredibly powerful artifacts crafted by the runelords known as runewells can siphon off fragments of sinful memories and emotions related to the runewells' associated sins from the souls of people dying nearby, fueling the spontaneous creation of new sinspawn. when enough sinful energies have been gathered within a runewell, it vomits forth a full-grown sinspawn with no prior loyalty to a long-lost runelord. all sinspawn inherently understand the runewells' role in the propagation of their kind, and they often establish small villages near awakened runewells, hunting down sentient beings they can use to propagate their communities. sinspawn locations sinspawn are found in regions where sources for their creation remain buried in ancient ruins—in golarion, this currently limits them to the frontier lands of varisia. but as they spread, so too does the potential knowledge of crafting more of them, and fleshwarpers around the world are hoping to craft new sinspawn of their own someday soon.

Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium. This ritual magically replicates the yellow musk creepers' ability to spread throughout a dead organism then mobilize its body. But rather than a completely mindless fungal carrier, the ritualist has some control over the infested creature's behavior.<br /> The magic of the ritual includes basic instructions and rules that guide the new fungal mycoguardian (in this case, a sporeborn). Simple instructions like “guard this room” or “slay all of the tiny creatures in this basement” should work well enough, but complex commands such as “deliver this letter to the Harbormaster of Caliphas” are doomed to failure.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Sporeborn Myceloid](/Monsters.aspx?ID=2604) (Creature 4)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Creating Mycoguardians</title>\r\n\r\nTo create a mycoguardian, such as a sporeborn, a ritualist can perform a ritual similar to [_create undead_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=10) called _create mycoguardian_, but providing valuable parasitic fungal spores instead of black onyx.

Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium. This ritual magically replicates the yellow musk creepers' ability to spread throughout a dead organism then mobilize its body. But rather than a completely mindless fungal carrier, the ritualist has some control over the infested creature's behavior. The magic of the ritual includes basic instructions and rules that guide the new fungal mycoguardian (in this case, a sporeborn).

Members Sporeborn Myceloid (Creature 4) Creating Mycoguardians To create a mycoguardian, such as a sporeborn, a ritualist can perform a ritual similar to create undead called create mycoguardian , but providing valuable parasitic fungal spores instead of black onyx. This ritual uses Fungus Lore (trained) or Nature (expert) for both the Primary Check and Secondary Checks, and lacks the Evil trait. Different Mycoguardians In addition to the sporeborn presented here, there are many versions of the create mycoguardian ritual for making mycoguardians other than sporeborn, such as for aquatic chytridions and so on. Some forms of mycoguardians, such as mycelial mindbores, come to be using their own unique methods and can't be created with a version of create mycoguardian . Fungal Ritualists While mycoguardians are rare, several different types of primal spellcasters might create a mycoguardian. Druids might turn the bodies of a poacher's victim against the poacher, seeking to avenge the wrongful death and rebalance the scales of life. Leshy spellcasters create mycoguardians to protect their hidden communities and sacred groves. The fey of Northern Fangwood transform fallen or rotted trees into crustoreal mycoguardians, massive arboreal-looking creatures covered in parasitic lichen. These lumbering sentinels patrol their borders, crushing all non-fey who dare approach. There are rumors of crustoreals being imbued with negative energy from the Gravelands and going berserk.

It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as [human](/Traits.aspx?ID=627) and [humanoid](/Traits.aspx?ID=628). You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality.\n\n **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)**<br /> [**Void Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83)<br /> **Immunities** [death ](/Traits.aspx?ID=571)effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)<br /> **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.<br /> **Vampire Vulnerabilities** All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below).</li><li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2745) of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=2316)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=74) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate ](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a  vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with [_holy water_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3001) while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul> **Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; **Effect** The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n **Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.<br /> **Create Servitor** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=580)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.<br /> **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658) actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.<br /> **[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1437) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1440) spells as guidelines. \n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a [bat swarm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45) or [giant bat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46). They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul> **Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.<br /> **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1501) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727) trait. The save DC uses the [high spell DC of the vampire's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br /> **Drink Blood** As a typical vampire, but the victim is [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) instead of 1.<br /> **Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=527), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_vapor form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1738) spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=62) while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang-shi, the feral vrykolakas, and the psychic vetalarana—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own.

Some vampires manage to retain a portion of their positive emotions, but this retention seems to always be accompanied by a reduction in their vampiric power, as though the hints of a soul remaining reject the completeness of their transformation to undeath. Where Rise The Dead Vampires are inevitably drawn to the places and people they knew in life. A vampire who lives in a city with active nightlife may maintain their mortal guise for many years before their undead nature becomes apparent, while vampires from simpler towns and villages may stalk nearby woods and caverns, yearning for a life forever denied them. Creating a Vampire You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer Hit Points. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vampire Abilities All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality. Darkvision Void Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, void) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall unconscious. If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. Vampire Vulnerabilities All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. Compulsions Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; Effect The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab. True Vampire Abilities Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. Create Servitor (divine, downtime) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Mist Escape Free Action Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take move actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. Children of the Night (divine, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Dominate Two Actions (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the high spell DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. Turn to Mist Single Action (air, concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the vapor form spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

inflict their nature on any creature whose blood they drink, almost any living creature can become one of these undead horrors. when you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. in most cases, it's more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire servitor, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). or you can use the guidelines presented under creating a vampire to turn an existing creature into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. in either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, mist escape, and drink blood work the same. pathfinder book of the dead also includes rules for turning player characters into vampires via an archetype. death wears many cloaks the most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are also known as “moroi.” they are most prevalent on golarion in the mistshrouded counties of ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the inner sea. other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang-shi, the feral vrykolakas, and the psychic vetalarana—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. dhampirs can be born of any of these vampires, though moroi-born dhampirs known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the inner sea region. the noble dead most vampires suffer an inevitable slide into moral decay and ethical dissolution, unable to retain whatever empathy and kindness they may have had in life. some vampires manage to retain a portion of their positive emotions, but this retention seems to always be accompanied by a reduction in their vampiric power, as though the hints of a soul remaining reject the completeness of their transformation to undeath. where rise the dead vampires are inevitably drawn to the places and people they knew in life. a vampire who lives in a city with active nightlife may maintain their mortal guise for many years before their undead nature becomes apparent, while vampires from simpler towns and villages may stalk nearby woods and caverns, yearning for a life forever denied them. creating a vampire you can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. it gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. increase ac, attack bonuses, dcs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. increase its damage with strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. if an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. reduce its hp by the amount listed on the table. the vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. these abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer hit points. starting level hp decrease fast healing/resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 basic vampire abilities all vampires gain the following abilities. if the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. it also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. you might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality. darkvision void healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep coffin restoration (divine, void) unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 hp. instead, they fall unconscious. if their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 hp, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. vampire vulnerabilities all vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. compulsions vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. a typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. at your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. the vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). revulsion a vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. to brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to raising a shield). if the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. after 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a dc 25 will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. on a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). stake a wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 hp and prevents them from healing above 0 hp, even in their coffin. staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. if the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 hp again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. if the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. sunlight if exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. the slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in

consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no hp from doing so. a victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. a blood transfusion, which requires a dc 20 medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. grab the creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain grab. true vampire abilities

The section on NPC advancement is especially useful for villains. To tell more varied stories, a GM can have the villains join up with new groups of followers or be under the employ of new benefactors, using their villainous skills for a new cause. Relative Villainy These characters are clearly set out as villains within the structure of a Pathfinder adventure's story, but that doesn't mean the people in the world see them as such universally. Villains often work best when otherwise well-meaning civilians are unable to see their malice, or when the villain is so charismatic or powerful they can bring others under their sway. You can use an influence encounter to play out the player characters trying to sway a powerful person away from the villain's influence, or even have both the PCs and the villain racing to influence the same person.
