As long-lived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods.

This hasn't prevented attempts to tame them or use them as guardians. Magic can be used to maintain control over a worm, but gifted, patient, and brave animal trainers can condition cave worms to serve in all manner of roles, such as living siege engines, shocking methods of executing foes, or merely pets.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Notorious Worms</title>\r\n\r\nSome societies view immense worms as natural disasters or incarnations of wrathful gods. Worms that have been active in a region often become part of that area's local lore. For example, in the notorious Cinderlands of eastern Varisia, Shoanti have long told tales of Cindermaw, an immense magma worm viewed by some as worthy of worship, and by others as the ultimate test of bravery.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\">Ravenous Tunnelers</title>\r\n\r\nCave worms are infamous for being nearly unstoppable and for swallowing their prey whole.

Some gain the ability to see in the dark, some grow fingernails long and hard enough to serve as claws, and others gain even stranger abilities specific to their hag mother. For instance, dream mays, the children of cuckoo hags, can gain an enhanced ability to resist the magic of dreams and sleep.

The Daemonic Paradox Daemons embody a fundamental paradox—while they are incarnations of death and seek to devour all that lives, they are themselves living creatures.

Unlike the hoards of other dragons, a mirage dragon takes care to polish every coin, gem, and precious metal to a mirror shine. These reflective items are placed methodically throughout the lair, allowing the dragon to see themself from all angles at any time.

Unlike the hoards of other dragons, a mirage dragon takes care to polish every coin, gem, and precious metal to a mirror shine. These reflective items are placed methodically throughout the lair, allowing the dragon to see themself from all angles at any time.

A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. <br />**Rejuvenation** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed.

This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. <br />**Fly Speed** equal to its Speed<br /> **Ghostly Hand** All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage.

Members Ghost Commoner (Creature 4), Ghost Mage (Creature 10) Creating a Ghost You can also use the following guidelines to turn living creatures into ghosts. Increase the creature's level by 2 and change its statistics as follows. Increase AC, saves, Perception, DCs, and skill modifiers by 2. Increase the most appropriate melee attack modifier by 4 to become ghostly hand (described below), and increase all other attack modifiers by 2. A ghost has a Strength modifier of –5 and a Constitution modifier of +0. Do not modify the ghost's Hit Points due to its new level. Ghost Abilities A ghost gains the ghost, incorporeal, spirit, and undead traits. Many become unholy. The base creature loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid, and any abilities or traits that rely on it being a living, corporeal creature. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghost. All ghosts gain the following abilities. Darkvision Site Bound A typical ghost can stray only a short distance from where it was killed or the place it haunts. A typical limit is 120 feet. Some ghosts are instead bound to a room, building, item, or creature that was special to it rather than a location. Rejuvenation (divine) When a ghost is destroyed, it re-forms after 2d4 days within the location it's bound to, fully healed. A ghost can be permanently destroyed only if someone sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting. Void Healing Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious Resistances all damage 5 (except force, ghost touch , spirit, or vitality; double resistance to non-magical). This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level. Fly Speed equal to its Speed Ghostly Hand All ghosts have a ghostly hand unarmed attack that deals void damage. It typically has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. Some ghosts wield ghostly memories of weapons they held in life, but the effect is the same. Special Abilities Select one or two of the following abilities, or potentially three if the ghost is 9th level or higher. These should relate to the ghost's death or its history. You can also create new abilities or adapt those from monsters or classes. For DCs, use the high spell DC of the ghost's level. Corrupting Gaze Two Actions The ghost stares at a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target takes 1d6 void damage plus 1d6 for every 2 levels the ghost has with a basic Will save. A creature that fails its save is also stupefied 1 for 1 minute. Draining Touch Two Actions With a touch, the ghost attempts to drain a living creature's life force. It makes a ghostly hand Strike but deals no damage on a hit. Instead, the target becomes drained 1 for 1 day, and the ghost regains HP equal to half its own level. Frightful Moan Single Action (auditory, divine, emotion, fear, mental) The ghost laments its fate, forcing each living creature within 30 feet to attempt a Will save. On a failure, a creature becomes frightened 2 (or frightened 3 on a critical failure). On a success, a creature is temporarily immune to this ghost's frightful moan for 1 minute.

Creating Graveknights You can turn an existing, living creature into a graveknight by completing the following steps. It's best to build a graveknight from scratch, but if you don't have the time, simply apply the following template. A creature should be at least level 5 before being converted to a graveknight. Increase the creature's level by 1. Increase its attack rolls, AC, saving throws, Perception, and skills by 1, its HP by 5, and its Strike damage by 1. Graveknight Abilities A graveknight gains the graveknight, undead, and unholy traits. They lose any abilities that come from being a living creature and any traits that represent their life, such as human and humanoid. Darkvision Void Healing Rejuvenation (divine) When a graveknight is destroyed, their armor rebuilds their body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with disintegrate ), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano. Immunities bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious, plus one energy type (same type as ruinous weapons). Sacrilegious Aura (aura, divine, void) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a vitality spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier. Devastating Blast Two Actions (arcane) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take limited use area damage for a creature of the graveknight's level with a basic Reflex save based on a high DC of the graveknight's level. The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of their ruinous weapons, and Devastating Blast gains the associated trait. Phantom Mount Three Actions (arcane, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount, as marvelous mount heightened to a rank equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike marvelous mount , the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again. Ruinous Weapons When created, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to their life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

Given their appearance, their affinity for hyenas should not be surprising; kholos share their homes, food, and even many of their behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, kholos have a notorious reputation, for much the same reason—their uncanny laughter, frightening intelligence, and efficient pack tactics make them intimidating competition or foes. Kholos are keen to lean into these rumors, using them as a form of psychological warfare against their enemies.\n\n Also like hyenas, kholos prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups. As kholo packs value all their members highly, any tactic that gives them an advantage in dangerous situations is seen as virtuous, while chivalry and honor are derided as pointlessly risky. It's a philosophy borne from a deep respect and love for their kholo brethren, but to most other people, it makes kholos terrible neighbors.\n\n Kholos willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead kholos, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a kholo, it's often more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; kholos see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead kholo, which they consider an insult to that kholo's memory and an implication that their flesh is unworthy of consumption. Eating the flesh of honored enemies is, for kholos, a respectful ritual, allowing that being to live on within the pack instead of rotting like trash on the ground.\n\n Kholo women are often larger and stronger than kholo men and are typically considered the leaders of their hunting packs and clans.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Members</title>\r\n[Kholo Bonekeeper](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3070) (Creature 3), [Kholo Hunter](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3069) (Creature 2), [Kholo Sergeant](/Monsters.aspx?ID=3071) (Creature 4)\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"/images/Icons/Sidebar_3_Locations.png\">Kholo Lairs</title>\r\n\r\nKholos dwell primarily on dry savannas and windswept plains. Thanks to their sturdy constitutions and strong survival instincts, they have few qualms about setting up holdings out in the open. Many kholos establish their encampments—typically made up of hide lean-tos and tents—atop sloping hills to better survey the region for potential prey.

Given their appearance, their affinity for hyenas should not be surprising; kholos share their homes, food, and even many of their behaviors with these animals. Much like hyenas, kholos have a notorious reputation, for much the same reason—their uncanny laughter, frightening intelligence, and efficient pack tactics make them intimidating competition or foes. Kholos are keen to lean into these rumors, using them as a form of psychological warfare against their enemies. Also like hyenas, kholos prefer to hunt in packs, and are exceptionally skilled at setting up ambushes or separating individual targets from larger groups. As kholo packs value all their members highly, any tactic that gives them an advantage in dangerous situations is seen as virtuous, while chivalry and honor are derided as pointlessly risky. It's a philosophy borne from a deep respect and love for their kholo brethren, but to most other people, it makes kholos terrible neighbors. Kholos willingly eat nearly any other creature, including dead kholos, which can evoke strong reactions from people and cultures with a taboo against cannibalism or desecrating the dead. To a kholo, it's often more offensive to not eat a dead body, no matter its origin; kholos see no point in wasting precious meat in a harsh and challenging world. Worse still is the refusal to eat the flesh of a dead kholo, which they consider an insult to that kholo's memory and an implication that their flesh is unworthy of consumption. Eating the flesh of honored enemies is, for kholos, a respectful ritual, allowing that being to live on within the pack instead of rotting like trash on the ground.

A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.\n\n Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.\n\n Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable.

When a mortal dies, their soul enters the River of Souls and eventually reaches the [Boneyard](/Planes.aspx?ID=39), where it is judged by [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290). The judged soul moves onto its appropriate domain of final rest— [Heaven](/Planes.aspx?ID=41), [Hell](/Planes.aspx?ID=42), [Abaddon](/Planes.aspx?ID=37), and so forth—where it becomes a shade.\n\n Complications arise, however, when a soul in queue for judgment prematurely departs from the River of Souls and is shunted into the [Ethereal Plane](/Planes.aspx?ID=34). Whether as a result of nefarious interlopers like [daemons ](/Traits.aspx?ID=568)or [hags](/Traits.aspx?ID=620), malignant planar magic, or even fate, these souls become dislodged from the natural order of life and death and linger in a sort of purgatory. Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath—at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence. Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls.

Planar scholars theorize that all of reality was originally formed from the Maelstrom in the early days of the cosmos—a theory proteans don't necessarily dispute. Defending Chaos Where proteans go, chaos follows. To proteans, there is no purer form of existence than entropy, and they constantly seek to oppose the establishment of order in the Great Beyond. However, proteans don't see life as being incompatible with chaos; rather, they simply believe beings— immortal or not—deserve complete freedom on their own terms. Other Proteans Many other proteans beyond those presented here dwell in the Maelstrom, including knowledge-corrupting akizendris, physically threatening naunets, spectral pelagastrs, nearly humanoid shapechanging ourdivars, and incredibly powerful izfiitars. Protean Divinities The most powerful of all proteans are a group of demigods known collectively as protean lords. Yet even their vast might pales in comparison to that of the mysterious Speakers of the Depths. The Speakers are the most enigmatic of the Maelstrom'sgods—even their exact nature is unknown, and scholars disagree as to whether they are even divinities or just aspects of the Maelstrom itself. Protean Names Individual proteans have two names: a traditional name in their hissing, confusing language; and an honorary title. The latter is easily translated to other languages, but a protean's traditional name can only rarely be uttered in any tongue other than Protean. As such, most proteans tend to go by their titles when dealing with outsiders, referring to themselves as, for example, “Song of Gentle Poison” or “Sibilant Cry of the Storm.” ","type":"Creature Family","url":"/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=457","weakness":{},"description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Creature Family\">[Protean](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=457)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Monster Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=221) pg. 270 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nGuardians of disorder and natives of the primal plane of chaos known as the [Maelstrom](/Planes.aspx?ID=43), proteans consider it their calling to spread bedlam and hasten entropic ends.

You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality.\n\n **[Darkvision](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=59)**<br /> [**Void Healing**](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83)<br /> **Immunities** [death ](/Traits.aspx?ID=571)effects, [disease](/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](/Traits.aspx?ID=669), [sleep](/Traits.aspx?ID=696)<br /> **Coffin Restoration** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [void](/Traits.aspx?ID=510)) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally.<br /> **Vampire Vulnerabilities** All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. \n<ul><li>**Compulsions** Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below).</li><li>**Revulsion** A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished [religious symbol](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2745) of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to [Raising a Shield](/Actions.aspx?ID=2316)). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [fleeing](/Conditions.aspx?ID=74) condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the [concentrate ](/Traits.aspx?ID=561)trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li><li>**Stake** A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a  vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95). If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with [_holy water_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3001) while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li><li>**Sunlight** If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes [slowed 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=92). The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul> **Climb Speed** Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed.<br /> **Claws** If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an [unarmed](/Traits.aspx?ID=719) claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the [agile](/Traits.aspx?ID=526) trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br /> **Drink Blood** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579)) **Requirements** A [grabbed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=77), [paralyzed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [restrained](/Conditions.aspx?ID=90), [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; **Effect** The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36) check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is [drained 1](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br /> A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.<br /> **Grab** The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain [Grab](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=45). \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">True Vampire Abilities</title> Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire.\n\n **Resistances** The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver.<br /> **Create Servitor** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=580)) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.<br /> **Mist Escape** <actions string=\"Free Action\" /> **Trigger** The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; **Effect** The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take [move](/Traits.aspx?ID=658) actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, [unconscious](/Conditions.aspx?ID=95), if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.<br /> **[Change Shape](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=55)** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the [_aerial form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1437) and [_animal form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1440) spells as guidelines. \n<ul><li>**Bat** The vampire changes into a [bat swarm](/Monsters.aspx?ID=45) or [giant bat](/Monsters.aspx?ID=46). They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</li></ul> **Children of the Night** ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647)) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.<br /> **Dominate** <actions string=\"Two Actions\" /> ([divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631), [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=647), [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727)) The vampire can cast [_dominate_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1501) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=727) trait. The save DC uses the [high spell DC of the vampire's level](/Rules.aspx?ID=2899), and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br /> **Drink Blood** As a typical vampire, but the victim is [drained 2](/Conditions.aspx?ID=68) instead of 1.<br /> **Turn to Mist** <actions string=\"Single Action\" /> ([air](/Traits.aspx?ID=527), [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561), [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579), [polymorph](/Traits.aspx?ID=670)) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the [_vapor form_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1738) spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses [fast healing](/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=62) while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

Members Vampire Count (Creature 6), Vampire Mastermind (Creature 9), Vampire Servitor (Creature 4) Group Families Vampire, Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Vampire, Nosferatu, Vampire, Strigoi, Vampire, Vetalarana, Vampire, Vrykolakas Building Vampires Because vampires can inflict their nature on any creature whose blood they drink, almost any living creature can become one of these undead horrors. When you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. In most cases, it's more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire servitor, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under Creating a Vampire to turn an existing creature into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. In either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, Mist Escape, and Drink Blood work the same. Pathfinder Book of the Dead also includes rules for turning player characters into vampires via an archetype. Death Wears Many Cloaks The most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are also known as “moroi.” They are most prevalent on Golarion in the mistshrouded counties of Ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the Inner Sea. Other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang-shi, the feral vrykolakas, and the psychic vetalarana—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. Dhampirs can be born of any of these vampires, though moroi-born dhampirs known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the Inner Sea region. The Noble Dead Most vampires suffer an inevitable slide into moral decay and ethical dissolution, unable to retain whatever empathy and kindness they may have had in life. Some vampires manage to retain a portion of their positive emotions, but this retention seems to always be accompanied by a reduction in their vampiric power, as though the hints of a soul remaining reject the completeness of their transformation to undeath. Where Rise The Dead Vampires are inevitably drawn to the places and people they knew in life. A vampire who lives in a city with active nightlife may maintain their mortal guise for many years before their undead nature becomes apparent, while vampires from simpler towns and villages may stalk nearby woods and caverns, yearning for a life forever denied them. Creating a Vampire You can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. It gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. Increase AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. Reduce its HP by the amount listed on the table. The vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. These abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer Hit Points. Starting Level HP Decrease Fast Healing/Resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 Basic Vampire Abilities All vampires gain the following abilities. If the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality. Darkvision Void Healing Immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep Coffin Restoration (divine, void) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall unconscious. If their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. Vampire Vulnerabilities All vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. Compulsions Vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). Revulsion A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). Stake A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. Sunlight If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. If the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. Climb Speed Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. Claws If the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage. Drink Blood Single Action (divine) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; Effect The vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary HP. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. Grab The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab. True Vampire Abilities Powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. A creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. Resistances The vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. Create Servitor (divine, downtime) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. A vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the GM), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC. Mist Escape Free Action Trigger The vampire is reduced to 0 HP; Effect The vampire uses Turn to Mist. They can take move actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. They automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. They gain echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. Children of the Night (divine, mental) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. Dominate Two Actions (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the high spell DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. Drink Blood As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. Turn to Mist Single Action (air, concentrate, divine, polymorph) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the vapor form spell, or back to their normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while turned to mist. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

(creature 6), vampire mastermind (creature 9), vampire servitor (creature 4) group families vampire, vampire, jiang-shi, vampire, nosferatu, vampire, strigoi, vampire, vetalarana, vampire, vrykolakas building vampires because vampires can inflict their nature on any creature whose blood they drink, almost any living creature can become one of these undead horrors. when you need to create a vampire for your game, you can do so in two ways. in most cases, it's more effective to build the vampire from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the vampire count, vampire servitor, and vampire mastermind presented on these pages were built). or you can use the guidelines presented under creating a vampire to turn an existing creature into a vampire, adjusting the monster as you see fit. in either case, specific vampire abilities like coffin restoration, mist escape, and drink blood work the same. pathfinder book of the dead also includes rules for turning player characters into vampires via an archetype. death wears many cloaks the most common and traditional vampires, as presented here, are also known as “moroi.” they are most prevalent on golarion in the mistshrouded counties of ustalav and found in small numbers in almost every nation of the inner sea. other types of vampires include the withered nosferatu, the hopping jiang-shi, the feral vrykolakas, and the psychic vetalarana—these vampires share many of the basic traits with moroi but possess new abilities of their own. dhampirs can be born of any of these vampires, though moroi-born dhampirs known as svetochers are the most common, especially in the inner sea region. the noble dead most vampires suffer an inevitable slide into moral decay and ethical dissolution, unable to retain whatever empathy and kindness they may have had in life. some vampires manage to retain a portion of their positive emotions, but this retention seems to always be accompanied by a reduction in their vampiric power, as though the hints of a soul remaining reject the completeness of their transformation to undeath. where rise the dead vampires are inevitably drawn to the places and people they knew in life. a vampire who lives in a city with active nightlife may maintain their mortal guise for many years before their undead nature becomes apparent, while vampires from simpler towns and villages may stalk nearby woods and caverns, yearning for a life forever denied them. creating a vampire you can turn an existing living creature into a vampire using the following steps. increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. it gains the undead and vampire traits, and usually the unholy trait. increase ac, attack bonuses, dcs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1. increase its damage with strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. if an ability can be used only a limited or infrequent number of times (such as a dragon's breath), increase the damage by 2 instead. reduce its hp by the amount listed on the table. the vampire gains fast healing and resistance to physical damage (except silver) as indicated in the table. these abilities are the reason the vampire has fewer hit points. starting level hp decrease fast healing/resistance 3–4 –20 5 5–7 –30 7 8–14 –40 10 15+ –60 15 basic vampire abilities all vampires gain the following abilities. if the base creature has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. it also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. you might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme, such as powers that rely on sunlight or which assume the presence of vitality. darkvision void healing immunities death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep coffin restoration (divine, void) unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 hp. instead, they fall unconscious. if their body rests in their coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 hp, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. vampire vulnerabilities all vampires possess the following vulnerabilities. compulsions vampires are creatures with strange and unknowable compulsions. a typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless they're transported while they hide within their coffin, nor can they enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. at your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions—a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. the vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome their compulsion just as they do their revulsion (see below). revulsion a vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a deity with a holy sanctification option. to brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must interact to do so, and it remains brandished for 1 round (similar to raising a shield). if the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the fleeing condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. after 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a vampire can attempt a dc 25 will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. on a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). stake a wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 hp and prevents them from healing above 0 hp, even in their coffin. staking a vampire requires 3 actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. if the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 hp again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. if the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed. sunlight if exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. the slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight. if the vampire loses all their actions in this way, they're destroyed. due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors. climb speed vampires gain a climb speed equal to their land speed. claws if the creature had hands, their fingernails thicken and grow, granting them an unarmed claw strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. if the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. if they had only non-agile attacks, their claws should deal three-quarters that damage. drink blood single action (divine) requirements a grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach; effect the vampire sinks their fangs into that creature to drink their blood. this requires an athletics check against the victim's fortitude dc if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. the victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains hp equal to 10% of their maximum hp, gaining any excess hp as temporary hp. drinking blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any hp to the vampire but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5. a vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no hp from doing so. a victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. a blood transfusion, which requires a dc 20 medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. grab the creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain grab. true vampire abilities powerful vampires that can create and control vampires from their victims gain additional vampire abilities, as detailed below. a creature below level 5 is not a significant enough creature to become a true vampire—you should instead simply make such a creature into a regular vampire servitor or rebuild the creature so that it's at least level 5 before becoming a true vampire. resistances the vampire resists all physical damage except magical silver. create servitor (divine, downtime) if a creature dies after being reduced to 0 hp by drink blood, the vampire can turn this victim into a vampire servitor by donating some of their own blood to the victim and burying the victim in earth for 3 nights. a vampiric servitor is compelled to obey its creator, but if a vampire controls too many vampiric servitors at once (as determined by the gm), or if the servitor is a higher level than the vampire that created it, strong-willed servitors can free themselves by succeeding at a will saving throw against the vampire's will dc. mist escape free action trigger the vampire is reduced to 0 hp; effect the vampire uses turn to mist. they can take move actions to move toward their coffin even though they're at 0 hp. while at 0 hp in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. they automatically return to their corporeal form, unconscious, if they reach their coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first. change shape single action (concentrate, divine, polymorph) the vampire transforms into one of their animal forms or back into their normal form. most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. bat the vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. they gain echolocation 40 feet, a land speed of 20 feet and a fly speed of 30 feet, and a fangs strike with the same attack bonus as their highest melee attack. these fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage. children of the night (divine, mental) the vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. these typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves but can include other creatures. the vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they're within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back. dominate two actions (divine, incapacitation, mental, visual) the vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. the save dc uses the high spell dc of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's dominate for 24 hours. fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 hp is insufficient to break the spell. drink blood as a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1. turn to mist single action (air, concentrate, divine, polymorph) the vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the vapor form spell, or back to their normal form. the vampire loses fast healing while turned to mist. the vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.

Animal Empathy The werecreature can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of its general kind. Claws The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage).

If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage. Change Shape Single Action (concentrate, polymorph, primal) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.
