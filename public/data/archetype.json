Cleric rangers are particularly fitting for deities who connect thematically to nature or have a bow as their favored weapon. (Or, in the case of Erastil, both!) Druids have the most thematic overlap with rangers among the spellcasters, allowing you to create a true master of the wilderness. Fighter rangers are among the most fearsome archers, combining the feats from both classes to create a fighting style unique to each fighter ranger. Some warden spells can also be particularly helpful to a fighter. Rogue rangers make excellent snipers or ranged skirmishers, with their rogue skills naturally playing into the ranger’s strengths. Witch rangers add a new prowess scouting to the information they can gain through their familiar and patron. Wizard rangers benefit greatly from ranger’s feat support, backing up their spells with ranged weapon attacks. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5088\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5089\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5090\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-5091\" />","trait_markdown":"","type":"Archetype","url":"/Archetypes.aspx?ID=215","weakness":{},"description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype 2\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Ranger](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=215)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 220 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\nYou have studied hunting, tracking, and wilderness survival, adding a ranger’s tools to your skill set.

Multiclass Rogue characters Nearly any character can benefit from the many skills and tricks the rogue archetype grants. Bard rogues expand their robust base of skills. They are also well-suited to take advantage of the distractions caused by their performances and otherwise apply their skills to combat. Cleric rogues often follow gods that support trickery in combat, such as Calistria, learning a combat style that fits their god. However, many clerics might need stealth and trickery when their voices are unwelcome. Druid rogues can ambush foes in other forms, seamlessly fading into the shadows of the natural world. Fighter rogues combine the fighter’s accuracy with extra damage, a deadly combination for archers or finesse fighters.

A group of bored tripkees looking for a little sport devised a game of using their tongues to gather fruit out of nearby trees. As the competition wore on and the bets escalated, the contestants began snatching falling fruit in midair and even using their tongues to push away the competition. While the names of the original competitors vary between tellings, all agree that the contest ended with a particularly magnificent tongue flick, landing an overripe mango squarely upon a losing bettor’s head.\n\nNo matter the origin, variants of the game and the martial art it spawned have become mainstays in tripkee society. In contrast to other fighting styles, thlipit doesn’t stand on ceremony or rigid discipline. Practitioners refer to themselves as contestants and play off the forms and moves as mere exercises or games. Despite this veneer of frivolity, thlipit can be just as dangerous in the mouth of an adept as any other weapon.\n\nThlipit combines fluid movements reminiscent of whip fighting with the leverage of a wrestler’s stance. It favors quick smacks, brief grabs, and short throws. Friend, foe, and the contestant themselves always remain in motion. Moves are often exaggerated to play up stylish elements for spectators or lure brash opponents into attacking early.\n\nNo formal schools exist to teach thlipit. Many tripkees are familiar with the style from childhood games, even if they haven’t developed the physicality to be considered a true contestant. Self-directed instruction remains common, though aspiring contestants will seek out veterans and ask to be taken on as apprentices. Even though this sort of self-directed instruction happens frequently, a veteran contestant will still occasionally take on a student or two to pass along particular forms or styles.\n\nThough thlipit originated with tripkees, tripkee migration to Vidrian and other population centers has exposed other peoples to the sport. Most notably, thlipit has become popular with the recent generation of iruxi youth, who have adapted it for use with a tail rather than a tongue.

Such warriors of legend often garner great reputations for their prowess and ferocity in battle, spawning legends of their invincibility. These stories almost always end in tragedy, however, for the blessings that carry the warriors to victory are always accompanied by a terrible curse that all but ensures their heroic tales have grim endings.\n\nSince the Godsrain scattered divine power across Golarion, more and more tales of such legendary warriors have sprung up all over the world, from Garund to Tian Xia, Casmaron to Arcadia, and across Avistan all the way to the Crown of the World. Hallmarks of these stories include heroes and villains who prefer lighter armor, hafted weapons, and who all seem to have an aversion or vulnerability to certain types of opponents.\n\n The would-be ruler Gulrik the Fierce slew a linnorm in the depths of the Grungir Forest but was slain by the arrows of lowly bandits before he could claim a kingdom for himself.

You might be a “true werecreature,” born to werecreature parents; you might have found yourself afflicted with the primal curse after surviving the bite of another werecreature; or you might have been transformed into a werecreature by powerful magic, perhaps even willingly. Although humanoids with the ability to transform into animals aren’t universally feared, they’re looked on with terror in many places because of a confusion with werecreatures or other threats. With the curse both spreading infectiously and robbing the afflicted control of their actions, those suspected of being werecreatures can rarely live in peace.\n\nWhile many werecreatures have little control over their own transformations, formal training or an exceptionally strong will has enabled you to exert a degree of mastery over the beast that rages within you, allowing you not only to assume your bestial shape at will but also retain your own mind while doing so. In many cases, this results in being able to prevent spreading the curse as well. This mastery is more common in societies that embrace or accept werecreatures, such as Ulfen countries in northern Avistan and communities of beastkin, wherever they can be found.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Curse of the Werecreature</title>\r\n\r\nA werecreature’s ability to transmit its curse to other victims through a bite is a core aspect of the werecreature mythology, but it has the potential to be disruptive in the hands (or jaws) of a PC. GMs and players should carefully consider whether granting a PC the ability to transform other humanoids into werecreatures will have a negative impact on the other players’ enjoyment of the game or distract from the overall story. Similarly, the loss of selfcontrol and amnesiac rampages traditionally associated with a werecreature’s compulsory transformation under a full moon might appeal to some players, whereas others might dislike the prospect of losing control of their characters for an extended period of time and choose to simply ignore that aspect of their condition. As always, GMs and players should work together to set expectations and boundaries beforehand to ensure the best possible experience for everyone at the table.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Roleplaying a Werecreature</title>\r\n\r\nAs a werecreature, your personality is likely to be heavily influenced by your relationship with the curse that made you what you are.

With the curse both spreading infectiously and robbing the afflicted control of their actions, those suspected of being werecreatures can rarely live in peace. While many werecreatures have little control over their own transformations, formal training or an exceptionally strong will has enabled you to exert a degree of mastery over the beast that rages within you, allowing you not only to assume your bestial shape at will but also retain your own mind while doing so. In many cases, this results in being able to prevent spreading the curse as well. This mastery is more common in societies that embrace or accept werecreatures, such as Ulfen countries in northern Avistan and communities of beastkin, wherever they can be found. Curse of the Werecreature A werecreature’s ability to transmit its curse to other victims through a bite is a core aspect of the werecreature mythology, but it has the potential to be disruptive in the hands (or jaws) of a PC. GMs and players should carefully consider whether granting a PC the ability to transform other humanoids into werecreatures will have a negative impact on the other players’ enjoyment of the game or distract from the overall story. Similarly, the loss of selfcontrol and amnesiac rampages traditionally associated with a werecreature’s compulsory transformation under a full moon might appeal to some players, whereas others might dislike the prospect of losing control of their characters for an extended period of time and choose to simply ignore that aspect of their condition. As always, GMs and players should work together to set expectations and boundaries beforehand to ensure the best possible experience for everyone at the table.

From the capacity to fight through deadly wounds to the production of painful electric jolts, the multitude of the world’s beasts presents a staggering array of diversity in form. Through rigorous training of your body, the meticulous study of treatises on wildlife, or by spending a large portion of your life among them, you have learned to adopt the martial techniques of many beasts. Some of these are a matter of simple mimicry, while others are impressive displays of primal magic.\n\nThe style of wild mimicry is believed to have been created long ago in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords.

Specializing in a variety of grabs, holds, and strikes, wrestlers are dangerous opponents whose techniques can leave a foe broken and defeated without taking their life. Though it appears brutal, wrestling is considered a respectable and innocuous art.\n\n The wrestling tradition is common all over Golarion. Gladiators and other warriors who fight for entertainment use wrestling techniques in combat. The discipline's focus on grappling is also useful in non-gladiatorial matches, as many foes are unable to contend with an opponent's hold. Grappling is particularly effective against spellcasters, who have a difficult time completing the gestures for their spells while grabbed. However, with the right technique, a seasoned wrestler can hold down just about any foe standing in their way. Such wrestlers are feared by their foes and respected by their allies.\n\n Wrestlers have storied traditions in the Hold of Belkzen, where orcs employ specialized grappling techniques to subdue the large animals they ride as mounts. Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing them in this manner creates a stronger bond between mount and rider.\n\n Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on powerful grappling techniques to make sure theyfre never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods and their past battles. These matches prominently feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Wrestler.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Additional Feats</title>\r\n\r\nThis archetype has some feats at a level other than their original level.\r\nSuch feats are marked with a \\*.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full rules on Additional Feats](/Rules.aspx?ID=1432).\r\n\r\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-6446\" />\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4780\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-5985\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6447\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6448\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-4773\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 4*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6449\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6450\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6451\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6452\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6453\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6008\"\r\noverride-title-right=\"Feat 8*\"\r\n\r\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6454\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6455\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6456\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6031\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-6049\"\n\n/>","name":"Wrestler","pfs":"Standard","prerequisite":"Trained in Athletics","prerequisite_markdown":"Trained in [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)","primary_source":"Player Core 2","primary_source_raw":"Player Core 2 pg. 222","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 222 <sup>1.1</sup>\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\nTrained in [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\n\n**Archetype Categories**\r\nCombat Style, Combat Style, Core\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 17\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nWrestlers are athletes who pit their strength and skill against powerful foes.

Orcs prefer wrestling these creatures partially to minimize harm to them, but also because they believe that the process of subduing them in this manner creates a stronger bond between mount and rider. Outside of the Inner Sea, wrestlers are common in Iblydos and Arcadia. Iblydan wrestlers focus on powerful grappling techniques to make sure theyfre never left without a means to fight on the battlefield, even if their weapons are destroyed. Arcadian wrestlers engage in matches designed to retell stories of ancient gods and their past battles. These matches prominently feature impressive acrobatic feats as well as highly technical grappling maneuvers.

Bolstering your athletic and martial abilities with mystical talents, you achieve rare heights with the bow or crossbow-transforming arrows or bolts into eldritch ammunition, sending projectiles zig-zagging unerringly to their targets, and manifesting arrows that can deliver spells or even instant death. The imbuing of raw magic into the point of an arrow is no easy feat. Eldritch archers are respected and feared for their prowess and make valuable members for any party of adventurers.\n\n While having some spellcasting ability increases your flexibility and power as an eldritch archer, you might learn the secrets of these arts without being independently skilled in spellcasting, instead learning the magic of the bow for its own sake.

Lowly mortals, ageless [angels](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=359), and primordial gods all face the same inescapable fate—to fade beyond memory and join the litany of the forgotten. The hastening of all life into this oblivion is the ultimate goal of the daemonic harbingers and their forces, including those mortals who exploit hate and hopelessness to bring calamity on the world. Chief among these demigods are the Riders of the Apocalypse, powerful fiends chosen to deliver death, famine, pestilence, and war.\n\nWhile neither the Riders nor their devotees feel obligated to make or keep promises, some mortals pledge their efforts to gain personal power and further the cause of entropy. Those destined to wreak the most destruction upon the world are known as apocalypse riders. Taking on such a mantle requires the utmost commitment to death and ruin.\n\nYou are such an apocalypse rider, and you have a terrifying ally in this fight, whether sent by daemonic overlords or spontaneously formed by [Abaddon](/Planes.aspx?ID=37) itself. This creature is a beastly mount with a form that matches your personality and goals, though its loyalties lie with Abaddon first. It will serve you faithfully as long as you continue to cause significant losses of life and inflict mass destruction. However, this apocalypse mount is more than just a way to monitor your obedience to the cause of misery. Your mount serves as a badge of office, signifying to [daemons](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=386) that you are effectively one of them.\n\nFrom astride her ferocious riding drake, **Arba Dwindletree** (destructive female gnome druid) staves off her Bleaching by wreaking havoc on crops and pitting fledgling settlements in the River Kingdoms against one another. Her delight in this chaos is tempered only when meddlesome fey creatures try to join in on the “fun.” Posing as an Order of the Nail Hellknight, **Owyn Darkoath** (manipulative male humanwarrior) pushes border tensions between Andoran and Cheliax, riding a pitch black destrier into battle. His goal is to force default on the Thrunes’ contract with Hell, bringing even greater war when [Asmodeus](/Deities.aspx?ID=278)’ forces come to collect what they’re owed.\n\n**Deng Fo-Murk** (cruel male human necromancer) uses his alchemical skills to reanimate the corpses of nobles and diplomats to sew political conflict between Hwanggot and its neighbors. He is poised to light the fuse on a powder keg of bloody consequences, through which he will gallop through on his terror bird mount.\n\nIn Abaddon, daemonkind sometimes demonstrates an odd mix of cooperation and hostility toward one another. This remains true of their mortal champions in the [Universe](/Planes.aspx?ID=26). War creates both famine and pestilence, drought creates war, and all worshippers of the end of all things engineer death in one form or another. An apocalypse rider may specialize in a particular rubric of death, but all daemonic servitors understand that the categories of the Four Riders frequently overlap one another. A group of riders might even cooperate to increase the scale of their deadly designs, but their apocalypse mounts carefully track who is delivering on their oath and who is not.\n\nApocalypse riders who fulfill the full scope of their commitment to the Riders often prove to be among the mightiest creatures on their world. Such servants of death are hardly sated once a project reaches its desired number of casualties. Successful riders often indulge in a new sort of killing or initiate a plan larger and more lethal in scope than their original commitments. A truly ambitious apocalypse rider will turn their baleful gaze to their own master, enforcing one of the few dogmas observed by daemonkind—all creatures must die, including those immortal demigods who remain unchallenged for too many centuries. Several times over the millennia, an apocalypse rider or exalted deacon has laid waste to a presiding Rider and claimed the daemon’s post. An individual who assumes the office of Rider immediately becomes a unique daemon and takes over the realm of the previous Rider on the plane of Abaddon.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Archetypes/Archetype_Apocalypse_Rider.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\n\n[Click here for more rules on using this archetype.](/Rules.aspx?ID=3320)\n\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7304\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7305\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7306\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7307\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7308\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7309\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7310\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7311\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7312\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7313\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7314\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7315\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7316\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7317\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7318\"\n\n/>\r\n\r\n<document\r\nlevel=\"2\"\r\nid=\"feat-7319\"\n\n/>","name":"Apocalypse Rider","pfs":"Limited","primary_source":"War of Immortals","primary_source_raw":"War of Immortals pg. 106","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-10-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 106\n\n**Archetype Category**\r\nCore\r\n\r\n**Number of Feats** 16\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nFrom the mightiest empire to the smallest star, everything dies.

From astride her ferocious riding drake, Arba Dwindletree (destructive female gnome druid) staves off her Bleaching by wreaking havoc on crops and pitting fledgling settlements in the River Kingdoms against one another. Her delight in this chaos is tempered only when meddlesome fey creatures try to join in on the “fun.” Posing as an Order of the Nail Hellknight, Owyn Darkoath (manipulative male humanwarrior) pushes border tensions between Andoran and Cheliax, riding a pitch black destrier into battle. His goal is to force default on the Thrunes’ contract with Hell, bringing even greater war when Asmodeus’ forces come to collect what they’re owed. Deng Fo-Murk (cruel male human necromancer) uses his alchemical skills to reanimate the corpses of nobles and diplomats to sew political conflict between Hwanggot and its neighbors. He is poised to light the fuse on a powder keg of bloody consequences, through which he will gallop through on his terror bird mount. In Abaddon, daemonkind sometimes demonstrates an odd mix of cooperation and hostility toward one another. This remains true of their mortal champions in the Universe. War creates both famine and pestilence, drought creates war, and all worshippers of the end of all things engineer death in one form or another. An apocalypse rider may specialize in a particular rubric of death, but all daemonic servitors understand that the categories of the Four Riders frequently overlap one another. A group of riders might even cooperate to increase the scale of their deadly designs, but their apocalypse mounts carefully track who is delivering on their oath and who is not. Apocalypse riders who fulfill the full scope of their commitment to the Riders often prove to be among the mightiest creatures on their world. Such servants of death are hardly sated once a project reaches its desired number of casualties. Successful riders often indulge in a new sort of killing or initiate a plan larger and more lethal in scope than their original commitments. A truly ambitious apocalypse rider will turn their baleful gaze to their own master, enforcing one of the few dogmas observed by daemonkind—all creatures must die, including those immortal demigods who remain unchallenged for too many centuries. Several times over the millennia, an apocalypse rider or exalted deacon has laid waste to a presiding Rider and claimed the daemon’s post. An individual who assumes the office of Rider immediately becomes a unique daemon and takes over the realm of the previous Rider on the plane of Abaddon.

archdevil who rises through the ranks of hell’s hierarchy, a powerful demon lord who seizes their realm in the outer rifts by bloody coup, a fearmongering sahk il tormentor who builds a palace of nightmares in their own personal demiplane, and a sadistic velstrac demagogue who cuts a swath of agony through the netherworld—all are archfiends. and while their motives, methods, domains, and minions differ, the evil they cause and the power they wield are universal. archfiends are fiends of legend, whose names live on forever, both among their own kind and the mortals who fear them. the most powerful of archfiends gain a horde of fiendish followers who help them bring evil to the mortal realms. moloch (tyrannical male devil general), general of hell, rules malebolge and directs hell’s armies from melqart keep at the heart of citadel ba’al. the lord of the sixth personifies wrathful destruction held in check by absolute discipline, and those who honor him often find their enemies crushed by the might of his armies. scheming in his twisted tree lair known as the witchbole, the lord of the blasted tarn, treerazer (corrupting male demon deforester), seeks dominion over the tanglebriar. once a powerful aspiring demon lord, the fiend was banished to the universe long ago and seeks revenge against the elven deities who imprisoned him within the surrounding forest and all they hold dear. searching for the perfect beings so she can end all others, raetorgash (cruel female velstrac demagogue), the skull-hoarder, resides in a bone tower at the heart of the charnel house targothieh with the netherworld. she often judges potential subjects by the shape and composition of their skulls, usually by first having them removed from the containing skin and muscle. you wish to number among these mythic beings. you have been gathering power, whether through the study of occult tomes, the accumulation of wealth, or the manipulation of heedless pawns in political spheres. you hold little regard for much of anything except your own goals, though you might briefly ally yourself with others for mutual protection or financial gain. however, should the need arise, you are prepared to abandon those ties without so much as a second thought. after all, you are destined to sit upon a throne that has room for only one —and that is you. the time has come for you to establish your realm, amass your fiendish hordes, and carve your own legend into the annals of history. click here for more rules on using this archetype. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7320\" />

with them legends of the exploits of companions as they protect that which is dearest to them. A beast lord is defined by their bond with their companion, an unshakable union that cannot be broken. This link can be brought forth through deific intervention, a traumatic shared event between companions that solidified their connection in magic, or even simply through a powerful friendship. A beast lord is not simply a title by which to measure those who unite with their companions, it is a collective merging of minds and souls. It’s been proposed that while the heart of one companion still beats, the other’s cannot cease, two drums in a perpetual song forever destined to be together as one. Stories of beast lords see them arising from their long-lost or secret dens to protect the lands, other companions, or lost members of their domains even long after most believed them dead and gone. These legends suggest that while even one life still lives, regardless of how many generations have passed, a beast lord can return to defend, and sometimes lead, those under their protection. \n\nWhile this archetype is called “beast lord,” your companion need not be an animal. A wizened [druid](/Classes.aspx?ID=34) might preach the [Green Faith](/Deities.aspx?ID=298) alongside a similarly weathered arboreal companion. An elven ranger might patrol the skies above their forest home on a riding [drake](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=404). An ingenious [inventor](/Classes.aspx?ID=19) might construct a robotic ally to aid in his workshop. What is important is that the beast lord has a strong bond with a companion, and that the two work hand-in-hand, almost sharing one mind.\n\nAcross the Inner Sea Region, **Adowyn** (untamed female human hunter) and **Leryn** (protective male wolf companion) travel protecting sacred natural lands and hunting those unfortunate enough to draw their ire. Their most recent exploits involved stopping an illegal strip-mining operation in the foothills of the Mindspin Mountains. \n\nIn the Mwangi Expanse, a young kobold named of **Vidni** (charismatic nonbinary kobold merchant) travels in hopes of selling their varied wares, keeping their most trusted friend and bodyguard **Hew** (fearsome male gorilla companion) close. The two have found some success in Senghor, and are saving up to buy their first trading ship. \n\nIn the Verduran Forest of Avistan, **Gal** (clever female centaur ranger) moves hoof in hoof with her boar companion **Jinx** (steadfast female boar companion), plunging tusk and arrow into the hearts of any would-be intruders. They are friendly with the local druids who reside on the Isle of Arenway, but aren’t beholden to their politics. \n\nIn Alkenstar, the inventor **Dr. Ashley Arrowbaud** (distractable female human inventor) labored for years within her laboratory until she one day emerged with a large, arthropod-shaped metal creature marked **SC- 04910** (sturdy genderless construct companion) who almost has a will of its own. The two have recently begun to discover the sinister actions of a secret society that includes members of the administration of Dr. Arrowbaud’s alma mater, Blythir College. \n\nAny of these characters may be, or may one day become, beast lords. By sharing a deep connection and the same goals, each pair may find a cause or quest that is important to them, which could eventually transform them into figures of legend. Tales of their exploits may inspire a similar connection in others, who might soon become another beast lord. \n\nYou have forged your own union with a loyal companion. The two of you share every burden, every strife, and a clear destiny. That future, no matter what foes you face, lands you protect, or quests you pursue, always shares the commonality of your undying connection to each other. Though there will be enemies who seek to drive you apart or even send you into the hands of [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=290), they will not be able to dissolve your partnership as long as you and your companion remain true to one another. You are one unit, one body and one mind, and the tribulations and trials set against you will quickly crumble through the power of your union. \n\nYou need not travel alone, though others won’t truly understand the connection you have with one another. You and your companion may make other friends or even form intimate relationships outside of this bond. Those ties will always be secondary, however, and that may cause some jealousy or resentment. But nothing like that will ever drive a wedge between you and your companion.

A beast lord is defined by their bond with their companion, an unshakable union that cannot be broken. This link can be brought forth through deific intervention, a traumatic shared event between companions that solidified their connection in magic, or even simply through a powerful friendship. A beast lord is not simply a title by which to measure those who unite with their companions, it is a collective merging of minds and souls. It’s been proposed that while the heart of one companion still beats, the other’s cannot cease, two drums in a perpetual song forever destined to be together as one. Stories of beast lords see them arising from their long-lost or secret dens to protect the lands, other companions, or lost members of their domains even long after most believed them dead and gone. These legends suggest that while even one life still lives, regardless of how many generations have passed, a beast lord can return to defend, and sometimes lead, those under their protection. While this archetype is called “beast lord,” your companion need not be an animal. A wizened druid might preach the Green Faith alongside a similarly weathered arboreal companion. An elven ranger might patrol the skies above their forest home on a riding drake. An ingenious inventor might construct a robotic ally to aid in his workshop. What is important is that the beast lord has a strong bond with a companion, and that the two work hand-in-hand, almost sharing one mind. Across the Inner Sea Region, Adowyn (untamed female human hunter) and Leryn (protective male wolf companion) travel protecting sacred natural lands and hunting those unfortunate enough to draw their ire. Their most recent exploits involved stopping an illegal strip-mining operation in the foothills of the Mindspin Mountains. In the Mwangi Expanse, a young kobold named of Vidni (charismatic nonbinary kobold merchant) travels in hopes of selling their varied wares, keeping their most trusted friend and bodyguard Hew (fearsome male gorilla companion) close. The two have found some success in Senghor, and are saving up to buy their first trading ship. In the Verduran Forest of Avistan, Gal (clever female centaur ranger) moves hoof in hoof with her boar companion Jinx (steadfast female boar companion), plunging tusk and arrow into the hearts of any would-be intruders. They are friendly with the local druids who reside on the Isle of Arenway, but aren’t beholden to their politics. In Alkenstar, the inventor Dr. Ashley Arrowbaud (distractable female human inventor) labored for years within her laboratory until she one day emerged with a large, arthropod-shaped metal creature marked SC- 04910 (sturdy genderless construct companion) who almost has a will of its own. The two have recently begun to discover the sinister actions of a secret society that includes members of the administration of Dr. Arrowbaud’s alma mater, Blythir College. Any of these characters may be, or may one day become, beast lords. By sharing a deep connection and the same goals, each pair may find a cause or quest that is important to them, which could eventually transform them into figures of legend. Tales of their exploits may inspire a similar connection in others, who might soon become another beast lord. You have forged your own union with a loyal companion. The two of you share every burden, every strife, and a clear destiny. That future, no matter what foes you face, lands you protect, or quests you pursue, always shares the commonality of your undying connection to each other. Though there will be enemies who seek to drive you apart or even send you into the hands of Pharasma, they will not be able to dissolve your partnership as long as you and your companion remain true to one another. You are one unit, one body and one mind, and the tribulations and trials set against you will quickly crumble through the power of your union. You need not travel alone, though others won’t truly understand the connection you have with one another.

But on rare occasions, one among the ranks of the rebels rises above and beyond to meet the tyrant at their level and lights the spark of an unstoppable revolutionary passion among their people, leading them to outmaneuver and eventually overpower their oppressor. Even should they fall at the hands of the tyrant’s forces, their martyrdom will inflame the movement, inspiring another to take on the mantle, for a broken chain’s greatest power is their bond to their movement.\n\nSome bards yet tell tales of broken chains who, unwilling to give up the fight against a tyrant, broke the bonds which destiny had over their mortality, and quite literally came back to life in the body of another fervent follower of the cause.

She has gone as far as to fight the ruler of nine Hells, [Asmodeus](/Deities.aspx?ID=278), to liberate one thousand innocent souls who were tricked into the clutches of hell by a vaguely worded diabolical contract. In the process, she paid a personal sacrifice: the loss of one of her feathery wings.\n\nIn Galt, the poets and philosophers **Darl Jubannich** (inspirational male human poet) and **Hosetter** (deceased male aiuvarin philosopher) led the people to revolt and fight against House Thrune, eventually forming the Revolutionary Council to rule the newly independent nation of Galt. Little did they know their lofty ideals would be turned against them when the council executed Hosetter with one of their final blade guillotines, trapping the philosopher’s soul. Fearing for his own life, Jubannich fled the country.\n\nIn Ravounel, a mysterious group of champions of the people called the Silver Ravens overthrew Barzillai Thrune to establish the new country, independent from Cheliax. Many claim they were aided by a band of adventurers whose names have never been discovered, but whose contributions were vital to the cause.\n\nThe Bright Lions of Mzali, lead by the devout **Sihar** (revolutionary female human fighter), wage a cloak-anddagger war of attrition against the forces of the tyrannical God-King [Walkena](/Deities.aspx?ID=159). Sihar has also revived the worship of the [Old Sun Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=19), a trio of deities once forgotten.\n\nAny of these individuals may be considered broken chains, destined to bring low a powerful tyrant or system of oppression and light a flame of liberty that will reverberate across history.\n\nWhich oppressive regime or ruler you will bring down is up to you. Leading your roused band of rebels, no unjust bond will survive for long, and evil despots across the land will quake in their boots at your passionate fury’s advance.

Because of this, Torman is respected and well-liked by those who fight for coin.\n\nContemplate the grand traveling warrior **Halimess** (ferocious female dromaar freedom fighter), whose cloak is made of white tiger pelt, whose helm is plated with the scales of dragons, and whose blades are crafted from the teeth of deep-sea leviathans. She travels the land not slaying monsters, but helping commoners, standing up to tyrants, and working the fields when others cannot.

that grand thing that reaches us all, the consequence of life. the shadow cast by light. do you ever consider your death? do you ever think about the life that follows it? pick up your blade, warrior. if your death is won in glory, you will be remembered for all time. that is the true path to immortality. woven into the threads of all cultures and traditions are various heroic champions, whose epic battles and martial exploits are sung of in hymns and sea shanties, whispered in hushed reverent tones, or sometimes deified and sacrificed to with burnt offerings. to be an eternal legend is to be one of these heroes. whether with blade, bow, or fist, your deeds will live forever through stories and poems, your very essence woven into the fabric of the universe. think of a grand warrior, whose deeds of valor are witnessed by peons and infantry soldiers, the stories of which are then passed down to their friends and family back home. that warrior’s name might be altered or mangled in the process, but he will be remembered all the same. the way his blade captured the light of the sun, the way his mien was that of a mighty king or celestial. when he is inevitably slain by the one stronger than him (for there will always be someone stronger), he will die with a grin. for his blade will become a sacred treasure upon which nations will be founded, his name the bedrock of religions. but for now, his entrance into a tavern is met with hushed whispers that he returns with a gregarious wink. or perhaps his passage through this world goes unheeded until that fateful day he joins the ranks of the dead. ponder the old man (wise male human herald), whose real name has been forgotten, replaced by an epithet. did he ever have a real name? as a herald of the god irori, the old man has helped many monks achieve their full potential and been the inspiration for several fighting styles. but don’t let his wizened appearance fool you. his fists are as hard as stone, his movements as swift as the wind. do not cross the old man if you wish for all your bones to remain unbroken and your skin unbruised. consider torman iates (risk-taking male human nomarch), renowned gladiator of absalom. after emerging triumphant from countless battles within the irorium arena, the grizzled human has parlayed his fame into successful careers as a tavern owner and local politician. he sits as a nomarch on the low council of absalom, where he helps pass legislation to aid exfighters like himself. because of this, torman is respected and well-liked by those who fight for coin. contemplate the grand traveling warrior halimess (ferocious female dromaar freedom fighter), whose cloak is made of white tiger pelt, whose helm is plated with the scales of dragons, and whose blades are crafted from the teeth of deep-sea leviathans. she travels the land not slaying monsters, but helping commoners, standing up to tyrants, and working the fields when others cannot. she is rarely forced to unsheathe her blade, but when she does, her legend grows. many intelligent monsters even fear her approach. suppose that any of these individuals are—or have the potential to be—eternal legends. they are unforgettable paragons of might and unmatched exemplars of finesse. in the face of insurmountable odds, they stand with conviction and determination. in that vein, you have answered the call of the eternal legend. your life will not be an easy one; no, you will face tribulations. you will end most of your days with aching muscles and the blood of your foes drying upon your armor. your battles will be like songs sung amidst storms—the pounding of a drum mixing with the rumble of thunder. hold steadfast your weapon, clench tightly your fist, and tales of your exploits will become the myths of tomorrow! click here for more rules on using this archetype. <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7374\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7375\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7376\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7377\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7378\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7379\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7380\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7381\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7382\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7383\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7384\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7385\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7386\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7387\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7388\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7389\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7390\" /> <document level=\"2\" id=\"feat-7391\" />","features":null},{"archetype":["Gelid Shard"],"archetype_category":["Artifact","Core"],"category":"archetype","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"archetype-201","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Archetype \" pfs=\"\">[Gelid Shard](/Archetypes.aspx?ID=201)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\n\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\n\n**Source** [Treasure Vault](/Sources.aspx?ID=191) pg. 184 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\nThe Varki wizard T'aak Chamin once traveled from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings northward, past the Winterwall Glacier and deep into the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World.

Aided by their hierophants, mortal allies who share in the godling’s power, these beings travel Golarion, building their personal legends and paving their own path to divinity. \n\nThe wizard **Razmir** (arrogant male human wouldbe- god) pursues divinity and immortality by whatever means he can acquire it, in locales across the Inner Sea both obvious and obscure. \n\nIn the Mwangi Expanse, it is believed that members of Old-Mage Jatembe’s Ten Magic Warriors still linger as immortal demigods, and that those they choose as their hierophants are candidates to receive the title of Magic Warrior themselves. \n\nOn the continent of Arcadia, in the region known as the Deadshot Lands, **Steel at Dawn** (compassionate female human gunslinger) and her sidekick hierophant **Nibbub** (plucky male chuspiqui scout) travel from remote community to remote community, protecting travelers from bandits and monsters while collecting an ever-growing congregation of grateful worshippers. \n\nAny of these characters might be, or might become, godlings. Less than demigods but closer to true godhood than an exemplar, godlings wield mythic power while sharing divine magic to pursue and accomplish their goals. \n\nWhatever it is that drives you to transcend mortality and walk among the immortals is for you to decide. The pull of divinity can cause you to become disconnected from mortal concerns, but your hierophant is there to keep you grounded and connected to the mortal world. This will be the most essential and important of the relationships you develop as you pursue your adventures, for your hierophant serves as a reminder of where you have come from and acts as a critical ally in helping you become the god you seek to be. Most hierophants become the first high priest of a godling who achieves full divinity, and some may even become a herald or similarly powerful ally. \n\nThe opportunity to achieve many great deeds lies before you, along with the power to shape the world to your desires. Godhood is not promised, but you have the power to achieve it if you can overcome the challenges barring your path. Dark priests, opposing gods, and powerful monsters are certain to stand between you and apotheosis, but the trust and assistance of those who believe in you can carry you forward.

Baruk later fell in battle against a [linnorm](/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=69), successfully slaying the beast before succumbing to its death curse. His helm, soaked in the blood of man and linnorm and saturated with the magic of the linnorm's curse, was claimed by Baruk's daughter, who often told stories about the helm giving her a bear's strength and ferocity, though it was unclear at the time whether this was a boast.\n\n Over many generations, the magic of the hood was proven true, and more than that, the magic continued to grow and evolve with ever-more-ursine attributes. As the belief and power of each new wearer soaked into the hood, the artifact's potential has continued to grow.
