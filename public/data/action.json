To Grow an item, you must meet the following requirements. \n<ul><li>The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=4), and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary.</li><li>You have the formula for the item; see [Getting Formulas](/Skills.aspx?ID=4) for more information.</li><li>You have an appropriate set of tools for growing the item. While cultivation and gardening tools are typical for plants, you might also use a different technique that requires a different set of tools. For instance, if you play music to help your plants grow, you might use a [musical instrument](/Equipment.aspx?ID=37) instead.</li><li>You must supply special fertilizers or other magical nutrients worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that quantity of fertilizers and magical nutrients when you Grow successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of magical nutrients you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You can also bring them with you in advance or forage for them with a skill like [Herbalism Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=8), gaining an amount of value based on the rules for [Earn Income](/Actions.aspx?ID=23).</li></ul> You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Grow the item based on its [level](/Rules.aspx?ID=554), [rarity](/Rules.aspx?ID=555), and other circumstances. Depending on the specifics of the type of item, it might be easier to Grow than it is to [Craft](/Actions.aspx?ID=43), or vice versa; typically, the GM can represent that by making an [easy or hard DC adjustment](/Rules.aspx?ID=555).\n\n If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the fertilizers and other magical nutrients you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in additional growth accelerants to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days cultivating the item. For each additional day taken, reduce the value of the accelerants you need to complete the item. This amount is determined using _Core Rulebook_ [Table 4–2: Income Earned](/Actions.aspx?ID=43), based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in accelerants. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off.\n\n You also have the option to allow the item to grow mostly untended, only stopping to supervise it occasionally, though the pace is much slower without your direct intervention. At the end of each season in which you spent at least 1 day of downtime to Grow the item, roll an additional Crafting check and reduce the value of accelerants you need to expend to complete the item by the corresponding amount.\r\n\r\n**Critical Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting.<br />\r\n**Success** Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank.<br />\r\n**Failure** You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over.<br />\r\n**Critical Failure** You fail to complete the item.

If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary. You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas for more information. You have an appropriate set of tools for growing the item. While cultivation and gardening tools are typical for plants, you might also use a different technique that requires a different set of tools. For instance, if you play music to help your plants grow, you might use a musical instrument instead. You must supply special fertilizers or other magical nutrients worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that quantity of fertilizers and magical nutrients when you Grow successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of magical nutrients you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You can also bring them with you in advance or forage for them with a skill like Herbalism Lore, gaining an amount of value based on the rules for Earn Income. You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Grow the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. Depending on the specifics of the type of item, it might be easier to Grow than it is to Craft, or vice versa; typically, the GM can represent that by making an easy or hard DC adjustment. If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the fertilizers and other magical nutrients you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in additional growth accelerants to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days cultivating the item. For each additional day taken, reduce the value of the accelerants you need to complete the item. This amount is determined using Core Rulebook Table 4–2: Income Earned, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in accelerants. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off. You also have the option to allow the item to grow mostly untended, only stopping to supervise it occasionally, though the pace is much slower without your direct intervention. At the end of each season in which you spent at least 1 day of downtime to Grow the item, roll an additional Crafting check and reduce the value of accelerants you need to expend to complete the item by the corresponding amount. Critical Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting. Success Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level and your proficiency rank. Failure You fail to complete the item. You can salvage the raw materials you supplied for their full value. If you want to try again, you must start over. Critical Failure You fail to complete the item. You ruin 10% of the fertilizers and nutrients you supplied, but you can salvage the rest. If you want to try again, you must start over.","trait":["Downtime","Manipulate","Rare"],"trait_group":["Mechanics","Rarity"],"trait_markdown":"[Downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=49), [Manipulate](/Traits.aspx?ID=104), [Rare](/Traits.aspx?ID=137)","trait_raw":["Downtime","Manipulate","Rare"],"type":"Action","url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=1905","weakness":{},"description":"You can grow an item from a living thing, most commonly a plant.

You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or ability scores. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.\n\n  Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor.\n\n  Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).\n\n  When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability.

Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=12) and [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=15), and an expert in [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=11), you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.\n\n  You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Class Features</title>  You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week.

Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites. You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation. Class Features You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard school—always at least a month.","trait":["Downtime"],"trait_group":["Mechanics"],"trait_markdown":"[Downtime](/Traits.aspx?ID=580)","trait_raw":["Downtime"],"type":"Action","url":"/Actions.aspx?ID=2634","weakness":{},"description":"Retraining offers a way to alter some of your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn't meet your expectations.
