While you have this condition, you are unconscious . Dying always includes a value, and if it ever reaches dying 4, you die. If you’re dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy’s critical hit or a critical failure on your save. If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition. Death and Dying Rules The doomed, dying, unconscious, and wounded conditions all relate to the process of coming closer to death. The full rules are on pages 459–461. The most significant information not contained in the conditions themselves is this: When you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points, you’re knocked out with the following effects: You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.” You gain the dying 1 condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the wounded condition, increase these values by your wounded value. If the damage came from a nonlethal attack or effect, you don’t gain the dying condition— you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.

Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time.

The GM determines when this occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute. \n\n### Assisted Recovery\n You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances (as determined by the GM). For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round.\n\n The GM decides how your help works, using the following examples as guidelines when there's not a specific action that applies. \n<ul><li>The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness.</li><li>Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to put out flames.</li><li>Automatically end the condition due to the type of help, such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself in a lake to end persistent fire damage.</li><li>Alter the number of actions required to help you if the means the helper uses are especially efficient or remarkably inefficient.</li></ul> \n\n### Immunities, Resistances, And Weaknesses\n Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to persistent damage. If an effect deals initial damage in addition to persistent damage, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the persistent damage. Usually, if an effect negates the initial damage, it also negates the persistent damage, such as with a slashing weapon that also deals persistent bleed damage because it cut you. The GM might rule otherwise in some situations. \n\n### Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions\n You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent damage conditions so long as they have different damage types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount. The damage you take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're dying with several types of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases your [dying](/Conditions.aspx?ID=11) condition only once.\r\n</aside>","name":"Persistent Damage","primary_source":"Core Rulebook","primary_source_raw":"Core Rulebook pg. 621","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2019-08-01","remaster_id":["condition-86"],"resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 621 <sup>4.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nPersistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations.

After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends. Persistent Damage Rules The additional rules presented below apply to persistent damage in certain cases. Persistent damage runs its course and automatically ends after a certain amount of time as fire burns out, blood clots, and the like. The GM determines when this occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute. ### Assisted Recovery You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances (as determined by the GM). For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round. The GM decides how your help works, using the following examples as guidelines when there's not a specific action that applies. The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness. Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to put out flames. Automatically end the condition due to the type of help, such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself in a lake to end persistent fire damage. Alter the number of actions required to help you if the means the helper uses are especially efficient or remarkably inefficient. ### Immunities, Resistances, And Weaknesses Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to persistent damage. If an effect deals initial damage in addition to persistent damage, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the persistent damage. Usually, if an effect negates the initial damage, it also negates the persistent damage, such as with a slashing weapon that also deals persistent bleed damage because it cut you. The GM might rule otherwise in some situations. ### Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent damage conditions so long as they have different damage types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount.

This works like targeting a hidden creature (requiring a DC 11 flat check), but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square. A creature can use the Seek action to try to find you.","type":"Condition","url":"/Conditions.aspx?ID=39","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon52","_id":"condition-40","_score":5.839371,"_source":{"category":"condition","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"condition-40","markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Condition\">[Unfriendly](/Conditions.aspx?ID=40)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Core Rulebook](/Sources.aspx?ID=1) pg. 623 <sup>4.0</sup>\r\n\r\nThis condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC.

You use all your actions to Strike or cast offensive cantrips, though the GM can have you use other actions to facilitate attack, such as draw a weapon, move so target is in reach, and so forth. Your targets are determined randomly by the GM. If you have no other viable targets, you target yourself, automatically hitting but not scoring a critical hit. If it's impossible for you to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, wasting your actions. Each time you take damage from an attack or spell, you can attempt a DC 11 flat check to recover from your confusion and end the condition.","type":"Condition","url":"/Conditions.aspx?ID=63","weakness":{}}},{"_index":"aon52","_id":"condition-64","_score":5.839371,"_source":{"category":"condition","exclude_from_search":false,"id":"condition-64","legacy_id":["condition-6"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Condition\">[Controlled](/Conditions.aspx?ID=64)</title>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 442 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n\r\nYou have been commanded, magically dominated, or otherwise had your will subverted.

This appears as “X persistent [type] damage,” where “X” is the amount of damage dealt and “[type]” is the damage type. Like normal damage, it can be doubled or halved based on the results of an attack roll or saving throw. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends. Persistent Damage Rules The additional rules presented below apply to persistent damage in certain cases. Persistent damage runs its course and automatically ends after a certain amount of time as fire burns out, blood clots, and the like. The GM determines when this occurs, but it usually takes 1 minute. Assisted Recovery You can take steps to help yourself recover from persistent damage, or an ally can help you, allowing you to attempt an additional flat check before the end of your turn. This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances (as determined by the GM). For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round. The GM decides how your help works, using the following examples as guidelines when there's not a specific action that applies. The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness. Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to put out flames. Automatically end the condition due to the type of help, such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself in a lake to end persistent fire damage. Alter the number of actions required to help you if the means the helper uses are especially efficient or remarkably inefficient. Immunities, Resistances, And Weaknesses Immunities, resistances, and weaknesses all apply to persistent damage. If an effect deals initial damage in addition to persistent damage, apply immunities, resistances, and weaknesses separately to the initial damage and to the persistent damage. Usually, if an effect negates the initial damage, it also negates the persistent damage, such as with a slashing weapon that also deals persistent bleed damage because it cut you. The GM might rule otherwise in some situations. Multiple Persistent Damage Conditions You can be simultaneously affected by multiple persistent damage conditions so long as they have different damage types. If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount. If it's unclear which damage would be higher, such as if you're already taking 2 persistent fire damage and then begin taking 1d4 persistent fire damage, the GM decides which source of damage would better fit the scene. The damage you take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're dying with several types of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases your dying condition only once.
