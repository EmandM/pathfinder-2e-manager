The deity of agriculture and craftsmanship, Daikitsu is one of the most important members of Tian Xia's pantheon, as her domains encapsulate everything that nurtures civilization. It's said that Daikitsu wears shapes the way a mortal might wear a scarf. She is every grain of rice and every farmer that harvests them, every stroke of a brush and the painter who made them. She is the kindness of the world and the artistry its denizens create, and the kitsune of Tian Xia take their role as descendants of her favored attendants very seriously.\n\n Daikitsu's most ardent followers claim their goddess loves Tian Xia the most, for where Shizuru is the sun and Hei Feng the rain, Daikitsu is the land that nourishes all who live on it. It's said that Daikitsu reached down from the heavens to embroider the land with even rows and thus brought the first fields and rice paddies to Tian Xia. To honor this, when one of her worshippers reaches maturity, they are given a plain cotton garment that they will spend the rest of their lives embroidering, slowly creating a design that spans the whole piece.\n\n To Daikitsu, a beautiful world is one that flourishes. Spring brings colorful flowers, summer luscious fruits, and autumn a bountiful harvest to help endure the endless cold of winter. As such, she tends to surround herself with similar things. This may explain her friendship with Nalinivati outside of the joint vernal fertility festival held in their honor, as well as their rapport despite the latter's prickliness. Altars to the Serpent's Kiss are regularly filled with woven offerings from Daikitsu's followers, left in respect to their odd friendship and to mimic the intricate gifts the gods bestow upon each other. What Daikitsu despises most is war. War ravages the fields, steals away lives that could have created artistry, and demands attention and resources that could have been used to build civilization. To wield anything sharper than a kama is to shun Daikitsu, and she does not tolerate such a snub.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** ensure the health of crops and vegetation, perfect a craft or trade, leave offerings for foxes, celebrate the turning of the seasons\r\n\r\n**Anathema** mistreat your tools, pass a beggar without giving alms, discriminate against sex workers or the lower class, commit murder or torture, harm an innocent\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nagriculture, craftsmanship, kitsune, rice\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Flail](/Weapons.aspx?ID=374)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=40), [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Pest Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=1626)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Humanoid Form](/Spells.aspx?ID=1560)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Illusory Scene](/Spells.aspx?ID=1570)\n\n</column>","name":"Daikitsu (Lady of Foxes)","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Tian Xia World Guide","primary_source_raw":"Tian Xia World Guide pg. 25","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-04-24","resistance":{},"sanctification":["holy"],"sanctification_raw":"can choose holy","search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 25\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Heal\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Crafting](/Skills.aspx?ID=37)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Flail](/Weapons.aspx?ID=374)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=40), [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Earth](/Domains.aspx?ID=73), [Family](/Domains.aspx?ID=74), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nDaikitsu, the Lady of Foxes, is a capricious yet benevolent god.

Fumeiyoshi realized that as long as his brother lived, he would never be first in Shizuru's eyes. So he lured Tsukiyo behind cloud cover, smothered him with his darkness, struck him with enough fury to leave a permanent gash on the moon, and consumed the light from Tsukiyo's body before burying his corpse in the earth. It did not take long for the clouds to part and for Shizuru to see what Fumeiyoshi had done. Shizuru then stripped Fumeiyoshi of his dominions, resurrected Tsukiyo, and entombed Fumeiyoshi in his brother's grave.

Though he has little concern for his victims or even his subordinates, Susumu has his pride as a warrior, and those who wish to keep his favor must have the same. The tools of battle—mighty weapons and well-trained steeds—are essential and must be well treated; abuse of either is both shortsighted and contemptible. Lands and strongholds must be defended, not out of any duty to their people, but because their loss is a blemish on their lord's reputation. A follower of Susumu must always be willing to stand up to any challenge and prove their worth.\n\n General Susumu is a skilled leader who seeks victory and glory in battle, regardless of the cost. His troops are oblivious to any innocent bystanders as they charge to engage the enemy, and his officers are unconcerned about any collateral damage their armies may cause to cities or villages. Foes who see Susumu's symbol emblazoned on their enemy's battle standards often drop their weapons and run rather than face the General's onslaught.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** seek glory in battle, loudly proclaim your victories, protect your possessions and strongholds\r\n\r\n**Anathema** cower from fights, refuse a challenge from an equal, mistreat your weapons, abuse your mount\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nfear, glory, warfare, death\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Dexterity\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=436)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=67), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Zeal](/Domains.aspx?ID=100)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** \r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Sure Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=1709)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Wall of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1753)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Weapon Storm](/Spells.aspx?ID=1758)\n\n</column>","name":"General Susumu (The Black Daimyo)","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Tian Xia World Guide","primary_source_raw":"Tian Xia World Guide pg. 27","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-04-24","resistance":{},"sanctification":["unholy"],"sanctification_raw":"can choose unholy","search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 27\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Harm\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Athletics](/Skills.aspx?ID=36)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Longbow](/Weapons.aspx?ID=436)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Confidence](/Domains.aspx?ID=67), [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Zeal](/Domains.aspx?ID=100)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nNo matter what trappings of righteousness it might wear, war is murder.

Depicted as a tengu with smoking black feathers and a nine- ring sword in his claws, Hei Feng is the lord of storms and possesses a temperament as volatile as the raging sea. He boasts a vast array of followers in Kwanlai, where the tengu population has constructed hundreds of statues venerating him along the coast. Smaller figures have also been erected as odes to his four retainers—the Counts of Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning. Outside of Kwanlai, temples dedicated to Hei Feng are present in nearly all of Tian Xia's seaside communities.\n\n Hei Feng does not hide his emotions, and his profanity-laced battle cries, passionate praises of street performances, and cackles of glee while imbibing copious amounts of alcohol are legendary. Instead of agonizing over the unpredictability of existence, worshippers of Hei Feng mimic their god's lust for life, grasping every moment and fully devoting themselves to their passions.\n\n One of the most prominent displays of this fervor occurs in Kwanlai during the Festival of Sea to Sky, a Tian holiday celebrating the Duke of Thunder. During the festival, Hei Fengans parade along the coast, hoisting palanquins bearing cloth and paper figures of Hei Feng and his four retainers above their heads. At every statue and shrine devoted to their god and his entourage, festival participants offer both loud prayers and sips of cloudless lightning, a potent rice liquor renowned for burning throats. Once everyone is properly tipsy, worshippers scatter firecrackers along the road and proceed to march through the explosions. Injuries ranging from singed eyebrows to painful burns are usually endured during this ritual, but to Hei Fengans, the Festival of Sea to Sky is the purest means of celebrating their god's fiery personality. Furthermore, Hei Feng always rewards the most fervent festival participants with fair weather during their next sea voyage.\n\n The Duke of Thunder's faithful wander far and wide, making them common fixtures of both adventuring groups and Tian Xia folklore. Curiously, Hei Fengans are also known for their extraordinarily polite behavior toward the temples and worshippers of Lady Jingxi, Hei Feng's estranged wife. While Hei Feng was never a loving husband, rumor has it that anyone who disrespects Lady Jingxi will face the full extent of the storm god's wrath.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** follow your passions, make token attempts to apologize to those you have wronged, respect the power of the sea and sky, encourage flashy entertainment\r\n\r\n**Anathema** fake friendship with those you despise; disrespect Hei Feng or Hei Feng’s estranged wife Lady Jingxi; ignore an affront to you, Hei Feng, or Lady Jingxi\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nsea, storms, tengu, sailors\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Jiu Huan Dao](/Weapons.aspx?ID=288)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Air](/Domains.aspx?ID=65), [Indulgence](/Domains.aspx?ID=79), [Lightning](/Domains.aspx?ID=47), [Water](/Domains.aspx?ID=98)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Gust of Wind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1550)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Hydraulic Torrent](/Spells.aspx?ID=1562)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Chain Lightning](/Spells.aspx?ID=1462)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Thunder’s intercessions are seen more commonly than other deities’ because of the god’s closeness to mortals, but also because of his tendency to dispense both boons and curses while in the depths of his drink.\r\n\r\n**Source** [Gods &amp; Magic - Web Supplement](/Sources.aspx?ID=19) pg. 7\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n**Minor Boon** The Heavenly Court’s most boastful deity ensures your boasts hit home.

He walks alongside the child who wants to go from crawling to running, does drills alongside the hero determined to better protect their peers, and bears witness to the adventurer who overcomes the most legendary of challenges and perils thrown in their way.

Attempting to encapsulate this beauty while acknowledging that transience can never be fully captured is a vital element of Lady Jingxi's poems, and those who worship her tend to be artists and writers who empathize with this struggle.\n\n Once known as the Lady of Lightning, Lady Jingxi previously worked alongside her rowdy husband, the storm god Hei Feng. Using her collection of magic mirrors, she shone light on the world, amplifying each of Hei Feng's lightning bolts with a blisteringly bright burst. The constant noise brought her no joy, and her true passion came from composing poetry in the fields of her plum tree garden. On one fateful day, Hei Feng summoned a bevy of lightning bolts and destroyed the garden in a drunken fit. A distraught Lady Jingxi left her husband and traveled across the cosmos, taking a magic mirror with her. She finally found contentment when she used the mirror to reflect color into the heavens, creating sunrise and sunset. Lady Jingxi has used this mirror every morning and evening since to bathe the world in calm hues of pink and purple, and the poems that she scribes during these ephemeral moments are legendary in their grace.\n\n Temples honoring Lady Jingxi can be found in Goka, Jinin, Kwanlai, Linvarre, and Minkai, and smaller shrines are scattered throughout Tian Xia, usually in regions off the beaten path.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** create art with words, master the written language, display the soft beauty of natural colors\r\n\r\n**Anathema** destroy a natural plum tree, drink excessive amounts of alcohol, act rude or boorish, commit torture or murder, knowingly harm an innocent\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ndaybreak, liminal spaces, twilight, solitude\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nIntelligence or Wisdom\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Fighting Fan](/Weapons.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=46), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=49)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Sun](/Domains.aspx?ID=92)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Dizzying Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1500)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Enthrall](/Spells.aspx?ID=1516)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Project Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=1640)\n\n</column>","name":"Lady Jingxi (The Poet of Dawn and Dusk)","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Tian Xia World Guide","primary_source_raw":"Tian Xia World Guide pg. 32","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-04-24","resistance":{},"sanctification":["holy"],"sanctification_raw":"can choose holy","search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 32\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Heal\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Fighting Fan](/Weapons.aspx?ID=284)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Creation](/Domains.aspx?ID=68), [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=46), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=49), [Sun](/Domains.aspx?ID=92)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nA gentle tengu woman wrapped in white with flowers adorning her feathers, the Poet of Dawn and Dusk is the patron of all who feel at home within the …\r\n</summary>","skill":["Performance"],"skill_markdown":"[Performance](/Skills.aspx?ID=45)","skill_mod":{},"source":["Tian Xia World Guide"],"source_raw":["Tian Xia World Guide pg. 32"],"source_category":["Lost Omens"],"source_markdown":"[Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 32","speed":{},"spell":["Dizzying Colors","Enthrall","Project Image"],"spell_markdown":"[Dizzying Colors](/Spells.aspx?ID=1500), [Enthrall](/Spells.aspx?ID=1516), [Project Image](/Spells.aspx?ID=1640)","summary":"A gentle tengu woman wrapped in white with flowers adorning her feathers, the Poet of Dawn and Dusk is the patron of all who feel at home within the …","summary_markdown":"A gentle tengu woman wrapped in white with flowers adorning her feathers, the Poet of Dawn and Dusk is the patron of all who feel at home within the …","text":" Lady Jingxi (The Poet of Dawn and Dusk) Source Tian Xia World Guide pg. 32 A gentle tengu woman wrapped in white with flowers adorning her feathers, the Poet of Dawn and Dusk is the patron of all who feel at home within the quiet, liminal spaces of the world.

Once known as the Lady of Lightning, Lady Jingxi previously worked alongside her rowdy husband, the storm god Hei Feng. Using her collection of magic mirrors, she shone light on the world, amplifying each of Hei Feng's lightning bolts with a blisteringly bright burst. The constant noise brought her no joy, and her true passion came from composing poetry in the fields of her plum tree garden. On one fateful day, Hei Feng summoned a bevy of lightning bolts and destroyed the garden in a drunken fit. A distraught Lady Jingxi left her husband and traveled across the cosmos, taking a magic mirror with her. She finally found contentment when she used the mirror to reflect color into the heavens, creating sunrise and sunset. Lady Jingxi has used this mirror every morning and evening since to bathe the world in calm hues of pink and purple, and the poems that she scribes during these ephemeral moments are legendary in their grace. Temples honoring Lady Jingxi can be found in Goka, Jinin, Kwanlai, Linvarre, and Minkai, and smaller shrines are scattered throughout Tian Xia, usually in regions off the beaten path.

Though many gods would be offended by this apparent slight, Lao Shu Po doesn't mind.\n\n Despite her self-serving attitude, Lao Shu Po is kind to those who follow her, casting the cover of nightfall over them so they may escape into the darkness, granting them her blessing to live until the next dawn. Perhaps she knows she stands to gain from them, or it could be out of a shred of mortal sympathy for their plight. After all, Lao Shu Po doesn't want destruction, or chaos, or apocalypse.

Theirs is a cautionary tale, one of love and hubris. Mugura was the rambunctious child of a raja and Nrithu was a shy street rat. Their worlds collided due to a passion for dance and both being unable to speak. The two of them quickly grew close, sharing a language of motion and rhythm, exchanging stories of lives worlds apart. Together, they became a beautiful dance duo across Tian Xia, entertaining streets and palaces alike and learning from each corner of the continent. As they grew in talent and fame, so did their devotion to storytelling and each other. Likha, the Teller god, saw this devotion and gave both a boon of godhood to perform together for eternity as well as tell stories to the gods. But then their relationship grew dark. The whims of their followers drew them away from each other and a deep love turned ugly as they bickered over the domains they blessed. With eternity to perform, they each became harsher on the other. Small mistakes compounded as standards grew. Bitter rivalry replaced love as they sabotaged each other in small ways on their cosmic stage, gajjelu ringing out like clashing blades with each step. Mugura and Nrithu are depicted as dancers in mirrored poses, their genders open to interpretation. Bells and powder adorn their shrines, and vibrant cloth is wrapped around their statues, always together and always in mirroring colors. Most followers of the Divine Dancers are pairs who give themselves to all forms of dance, dedicating their performances to the gods in hopes of finding their prolific success. Dancers will have their gajjelu blessed at their first recital and will thereafter speak to their partners solely in dance to attain perfect synchronization. While Mugura and Nrithu are primarily gods of dance, their followers are diverse. Any strong pairs often seek the gods' favor. Children gleefully play as the two, while adults tease those in bickering relationships to learn from Mugura and Nrithu's story. People who hate each other but are forced to work together often feel cursed by the two gods.

Her ascent to godhood is a story of dedication to craft, knowledge, and community. As a powerful sorceress, she became the first queen of Nagajor. She cared deeply for her lovers and even deeper for her children. She also cared for the snakes around her and took in those who were lost and without family. She created communities with structure that helped sustain her ambitions and pushed others to pursue magical knowledge. She later transformed herself into a naga to further protect and nurture those she loved, proving to herself and everyone else that dedication and curiosity, with a sprinkle of strong magic, can break all barriers. Upon reaching godhood, she saw to reward those who wished to also care for others, give their next generation a life of love and ambition, and take in those less fortunate.\n\n Nalinivati is depicted as a large naga with colorful scales and features, her body shimmering in mesmerizing patterns. Her body fluidly shifts between more humanoid or more snake-like depending on who she's communing with and whether she wishes to comfort or to terrify them. Nalinivati is adorned with jewelry and flowers given to her as gifts from her worshippers, while trinkets, crafts, and books hang off her waist. She is also often paired with Daikitsu, the Lady of Foxes, with whom Nalinivati shares a long history of intimate platonic friendship. They are honored as deities of fertility, and Daikitsu's shrines are often adorned with colorful scales or books as a sign of respect between goddesses.\n\n Many people pray to Nalinivati when trying to start a family, giving offerings of meat and milk to wild snakes. Those same families will continue to pray to her when their children begin their studies.

Her ascent to godhood is a story of dedication to craft, knowledge, and community. As a powerful sorceress, she became the first queen of Nagajor. She cared deeply for her lovers and even deeper for her children. She also cared for the snakes around her and took in those who were lost and without family. She created communities with structure that helped sustain her ambitions and pushed others to pursue magical knowledge. She later transformed herself into a naga to further protect and nurture those she loved, proving to herself and everyone else that dedication and curiosity, with a sprinkle of strong magic, can break all barriers. Upon reaching godhood, she saw to reward those who wished to also care for others, give their next generation a life of love and ambition, and take in those less fortunate. Nalinivati is depicted as a large naga with colorful scales and features, her body shimmering in mesmerizing patterns. Her body fluidly shifts between more humanoid or more snake-like depending on who she's communing with and whether she wishes to comfort or to terrify them. Nalinivati is adorned with jewelry and flowers given to her as gifts from her worshippers, while trinkets, crafts, and books hang off her waist. She is also often paired with Daikitsu, the Lady of Foxes, with whom Nalinivati shares a long history of intimate platonic friendship. They are honored as deities of fertility, and Daikitsu's shrines are often adorned with colorful scales or books as a sign of respect between goddesses. Many people pray to Nalinivati when trying to start a family, giving offerings of meat and milk to wild snakes.

Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body.

Minor Curse The secrets of magic become mentally taxing. You are permanently stupefied 1. Moderate Curse Your magic wars against itself like Nethys’s dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 flat check. On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same level on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same level on your intended targets. If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same level that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell that healed undead and harmed the living). You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast. Major Curse Nethys severs your connection to magic. You lose all your spellcasting abilities and cannot gain any future spellcasting.

To others, it’s a malleable tool. And to a few, it’s a source of purpose. With an understanding of spellcasting, creatures can cause fire to erupt from their hands, call otherworldly beings to aid them, bewitch the senses, and even bring the dead back to life. The ability to reshape reality to better suit one’s needs and desires is a powerful call that most only dream of being able to answer, and few are ever able to truly master such might.\n\n One such master was Nethys, who was revered as a god-king in ancient Osirion. Having sought to unlock all of the secrets and potential held within the planes and beyond, Nethys shattered his own mind from the sheer overload of knowledge to which he was exposed. Witnessing all of creation, the secrets of the universe, and the vast expanse of what has been seen and will be seen rent his mind in the same moment he elevated to the status of a god. Nethys gained unlimited power and the skill to utilize it, but at the cost of his core self and mental security. This resulted in a split soul, two sides warring within the same body. One seeks to destroy the world, to purge it through fire and ruin, and to conquer all that exists. The other attempts to protect the world, to elevate and educate, and to release it from its limits.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Gods of the Inner Sea](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=1)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** seek out magical power and use it\r\n\r\n**Anathema** continually pursue mundane paths over magical ones\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nmagic\n\n**Pantheons**\r\n[Wards of the Pharaoh](/Deities.aspx?ID=208)\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Deities/Nethys.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nWisdom or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Arcana](/Skills.aspx?ID=2)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=367)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Destruction](/Domains.aspx?ID=71), [Knowledge](/Domains.aspx?ID=80), [Magic](/Domains.aspx?ID=82), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Glyph](/Domains.aspx?ID=46)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Force Barrage](/Spells.aspx?ID=1536)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Embed Message](/Spells.aspx?ID=1511)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Levitate](/Spells.aspx?ID=1584)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Flicker](/Spells.aspx?ID=1532)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Telekinetic Haul](/Spells.aspx?ID=1716)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Wall of Force](/Spells.aspx?ID=1749)\n\n- **7th**\r\n[Warp Mind](/Spells.aspx?ID=1754)\n\n- **8th**\r\n[Quandary](/Spells.aspx?ID=1644)\n\n- **9th**\r\n[Detonate Magic](/Spells.aspx?ID=1488)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nNethys is often impartial to his followers and their wishes, so it is rare to gain a heightened favor from the god of magic.

They are both one god and a thousand, both mortal and yet infinite. The Thousand- Souled Chorus is neither a god of a single soul nor a mortal who ascended the heights to godhood, for that would imply they rose out of exceptionable mortality. Instead, they are a god borne of blood, sweat, and death, of the defenseless who were not protected and now seek to protect those who can't protect themselves. Phi Deva is most often worshipped by the common people, though anyone who seeks their protection is welcomed into the chorus. But powerful figures beware, for bringing the sights of the Chorus onto oneself can be dangerous for those who do not check their own power. Phi Deva's appearance is never a settled thing. To some they appear as a shadowy humanoid; to others, they may appear as someone who died too soon, a flock of birds, or however one might imagine a god to appear. While a defender of those who are unable to defend themselves, Phi Deva is far from a pacifist god. To the Chorus, defense is not best served by pacifism or inaction but instead by forceful action.\n\n Worship of Phi Deva is commonly carried out through song. Intricate and ever-weaving, the songs sung often are those meant to comfort and allay, though some are songs of conflict, meant to strike fear in the hearts of one's enemies. Most often, these songs have been sung in hopeless battles and against armies of empires, where both prayer and fury coalesced into one.

They are both one god and a thousand, both mortal and yet infinite. The Thousand- Souled Chorus is neither a god of a single soul nor a mortal who ascended the heights to godhood, for that would imply they rose out of exceptionable mortality. Instead, they are a god borne of blood, sweat, and death, of the defenseless who were not protected and now seek to protect those who can't protect themselves. Phi Deva is most often worshipped by the common people, though anyone who seeks their protection is welcomed into the chorus. But powerful figures beware, for bringing the sights of the Chorus onto oneself can be dangerous for those who do not check their own power. Phi Deva's appearance is never a settled thing. To some they appear as a shadowy humanoid; to others, they may appear as someone who died too soon, a flock of birds, or however one might imagine a god to appear. While a defender of those who are unable to defend themselves, Phi Deva is far from a pacifist god. To the Chorus, defense is not best served by pacifism or inaction but instead by forceful action. Worship of Phi Deva is commonly carried out through song. Intricate and ever-weaving, the songs sung often are those meant to comfort and allay, though some are songs of conflict, meant to strike fear in the hearts of one's enemies. Most often, these songs have been sung in hopeless battles and against armies of empires, where both prayer and fury coalesced into one. For those who can't sing, alternative methods of noise making are offered—instruments, clapping, and dancing are all welcome in worship, and often directly written into the songs themselves.

Monkey was born from a magic stone atop a sacred mountain, where he grew up among a community of wild monkeys and proclaimed himself the Monkey King. Realizing his own mortality and that his happiness would eventually end, he left the mountain in search of knowledge on how to beat death. During his travels, Monkey unsuccessfully sought the secret of immortality from Qi Zhong, the Master of Medicine, and eventually became a disciple of Irori, the Enlightened One. Under Irori's tutelage, Sun Wukong would learn the magical and martial arts— notably the way of immortality, cloud leaping, and how to transform into a variety of creatures. Seeing flaws in the Monkey King's character, particularly his rebellious instincts and contempt toward authority, Irori forbade him from revealing his nature as a disciple.\n\n After being dismissed by Irori for his lack of self-restraint, Sun Wukong caught the attention of the gods by slaying demons, causing mischief, and stealing sacred fruits. The gods saw his hatred of evil and scorn for authority as a sharp contrast to his whimsical, optimistic, and tolerant personality, and his free heart was considered impetuous and a cause of heavenly havoc. Despite their best efforts, the gods of Tian Xia could not control Sun Wukong's behavior. After a particularly shameful incident, where Wukong accidentally set the celestial orchards ablaze, the Ruler of Heaven, Shizuru, had no choice but to sentence him to death in order to maintain divine order. Against all odds, Sun Wukong traveled to Pharasma's Boneyard and erased his name from her records, ensuring that he could never be removed from existence.\n\n Those that are martially inclined often worship Sun Wukong not only for his martial arts skills, but also his resourcefulness, tolerance, and loyal nature, a true hero for the downtrodden. Rogues and scoundrels often gravitate toward Monkey's disdain for the law and authority figures and view Sun Wukong as a divine role model, the ultimate trickster. Of all the Tian gods, Sun Wukong is one that inhabitants of the mortal Universe are most likely to encounter— drinking, causing problems for authority figures, helping the weak, and reveling in his status as a legendary hero of the common folk.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** live life freely, drink, play pranks\r\n\r\n**Anathema** refuse a reasonable bet or duel, let social pressure change your behavior\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\ndrunkenness, nature, trickery\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nStrength or Charisma\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) or [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=34)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Bo Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=372)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Indulgence](/Domains.aspx?ID=79), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77), [Magic](/Domains.aspx?ID=82), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Jump](/Spells.aspx?ID=1580)\n\n- **3rd**\r\n[Mad Monkeys](/Spells.aspx?ID=1590)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Creation](/Spells.aspx?ID=1477)\n\n</column>","name":"Sun Wukong (The Monkey King)","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Tian Xia World Guide","primary_source_raw":"Tian Xia World Guide pg. 42","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-04-24","resistance":{},"sanctification":["holy","unholy"],"sanctification_raw":"can choose holy or unholy","search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 42\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Harm or Heal\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Acrobatics](/Skills.aspx?ID=34)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Bo Staff](/Weapons.aspx?ID=372)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Freedom](/Domains.aspx?ID=77), [Indulgence](/Domains.aspx?ID=79), [Magic](/Domains.aspx?ID=82), [Might](/Domains.aspx?ID=83), [Nature](/Domains.aspx?ID=85), [Protection](/Domains.aspx?ID=90), [Travel](/Domains.aspx?ID=93), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nSun Wukong, also known as Monkey or the Monkey King, is a god famed for his rebellious nature and legendary martial exploits.

Despite the efforts of Pharasma's faithful to scrub the Lady's name from the annals of history, a few scattered sects still worship her and transmit her teachings. Their ranks are often closed to outsiders, and their initiation rituals are arduous and famously cryptic. In spite of the Lady of the North Star's love for secrecy, she has one famous weakness: her empathy for those nearing death. She has been known to take pity on those afflicted with incurable curses and ailments of all kinds, appearing to prospective followers through dreams and visions. There, she presents them with a final challenge: to uncover her lost path to immortality before their time runs out.\n\n According to legend, the Lady of the North Star once descended to the mortal world, disguising herself as a human. She witnessed firsthand the horrors of mortality as her newfound friends grew old and weak with time, with even the strongest warriors ultimately succumbing to illness and infirmity. Her frigid heart was moved.

As with any other god, the Prince of the Moon is understood in different ways depending on time and place, which he views as mortal concerns rather than something he should control. Tsukiyo has little impact on state functions or annual events, but his influence runs deep in the daily lives and perspectives of Minkai. He is the Prince of the Moon, representing the night and the natural changes everyone experiences in life.\n\n For the average person, Tsukiyo is worshipped quietly through self-reflection and meditation. In recent decades, his story has become primarily about trauma and transformation, where the boisterous lover of Shizuru is murdered out of jealousy, then resurrected as a distant and contemplative man. It is thought that his death and return caused him to drift from his old life, making him a wandering guide for social outcasts and lost spirits. Based on this view, the most devout of his followers join a priesthood dedicated to counseling and social support for the misunderstood. Priests of Tsukiyo often travel widely for the first five years of their training, observing the diversity of the world's peoples. With the understanding that there are no quick fixes to prejudice or exclusion, they eventually settle in a community where they believe they can provide stability and steady guidance.\n\n In the ancient records of Minkai, there is an entry that suggests Tsukiyo's older brother, Fumeiyoshi, was not solely driven by jealousy over the depth of Tsukiyo and Shizuru's relationship. Fumeiyoshi truly believed that he and his brother must have something in common, and that what was good and warm about Tsukiyo was ultimately just a reflection of Shizuru's light. Although there was no proof of this, his resentment and jealousy ultimately combined and led to him murdering his younger brother. For this reason, the annual Jukuk-o festival is held every winter solstice to not only show devotion to Tsukiyo and practice self-reflection, but also to consider the harm caused by unfounded judgments. Beyond Minkai, Tsukiyo is an important patron to samsarans, who seek enlightenment through reincarnation and learning from the past.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** provide aid and counsel without judgment to those who seek help, help the dead find their rest, amplify or help speak for the powerless and demonized\r\n\r\n**Anathema** harm another out of envy, force aid on those who do not want it, inflict harmful mental effects on others as punishment, knowingly hurt the innocent, commit murder\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\njade, the moon, spirits\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nConstitution or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Heal](/Spells.aspx?ID=148)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Delirium](/Domains.aspx?ID=43), [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=49), [Soul](/Domains.aspx?ID=51)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=40)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Soothe](/Spells.aspx?ID=1678)\n\n- **4th**\r\n[Peaceful Bubble](/Spells.aspx?ID=1624)\n\n- **5th**\r\n[Hallucination](/Spells.aspx?ID=1551)\n\n</column><title level=\"2\">Divine Intercession</title>\r\n\r\nEver mercurial, the Prince of the Moon gives his blessings rarely and somewhat spontaneously.

Once, when you roll a failure on a saving throw against a [mental](/Traits.aspx?ID=106) effect, you get a critical success instead. Tsukiyo typically grants this boon against a particularly consequential mental effect.\r\n\r\n**Moderate Boon** Tsukiyo watches over you and guards your sleep. You are guaranteed a peaceful night’s rest no matter what conditions you are sleeping in. Even nightmare and similar abilities can’t disrupt your sleep unless they come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source.\r\n\r\n**Major Boon** Tsukiyo shares some of his own nature and can lead a favored soul back along the same path he has walked.

You lose any low-light vision or darkvision you have, and you treat all light levels as one step lower.\r\n\r\n**Moderate Curse** If Tsukiyo is particularly offended by someone, they may find themselves lost in delusions of moonlight. When attempting to navigate or find something at night, if you roll a success or critical success on your Perception check, [Survival](/Skills.aspx?ID=16) check, or other check to do so, you get a failure instead.\r\n\r\n**Major Curse** When Tsukiyo truly loses patience with someone, he forces them to experience the hardships of others firsthand. Whenever you touch another creature or another creature touches you, you immediately gain any negative curses, diseases, and conditions they are suffering. These effects spread to you even when you Strike another creature or a creature Strikes you.\r\n</column>","name":"Tsukiyo (Prince of the Moon)","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Tian Xia World Guide","primary_source_raw":"Tian Xia World Guide pg. 43","primary_source_category":"Lost Omens","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"release_date":"2024-04-24","resistance":{},"sanctification":["holy"],"sanctification_raw":"can choose holy","search_markdown":"<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Tian Xia World Guide](/Sources.aspx?ID=223) pg. 43\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** Heal\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Occultism](/Skills.aspx?ID=44)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Spear](/Weapons.aspx?ID=365)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Change](/Domains.aspx?ID=40), [Delirium](/Domains.aspx?ID=43), [Moon](/Domains.aspx?ID=84), [Repose](/Domains.aspx?ID=49), [Soul](/Domains.aspx?ID=51)\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nTsukiyo has always been considered a complicated god in Tian Xia, constantly changing like the phases of the moon.

Tsukiyo has little impact on state functions or annual events, but his influence runs deep in the daily lives and perspectives of Minkai. He is the Prince of the Moon, representing the night and the natural changes everyone experiences in life.

With the understanding that there are no quick fixes to prejudice or exclusion, they eventually settle in a community where they believe they can provide stability and steady guidance.

Fumeiyoshi truly believed that he and his brother must have something in common, and that what was good and warm about Tsukiyo was ultimately just a reflection of Shizuru's light. Although there was no proof of this, his resentment and jealousy ultimately combined and led to him murdering his younger brother. For this reason, the annual Jukuk-o festival is held every winter solstice to not only show devotion to Tsukiyo and practice self-reflection, but also to consider the harm caused by unfounded judgments.

When Fumeiyoshi was found guilty of murdering his brother Tsukiyo, it was Yaezhing who was tasked with burying him alive and making an example of those who would cross the Court. When assassins and executioners are hired to carry out capital punishments, it is Yaezhing who they pray to for a steady hand and the conviction to follow through.\n\n As the god of assassins and executioners, Yaezhing oversees contracted death and guides those who are tasked with the duty of killing others. He is also seen as a figure of justice, meting out bloody punishment to all who deserve it, whether godly or mortal. Judges and constables pray to him for criminals to be convicted and given the harshest sentences. Those who have been wronged by the corrupt courts of mortals beg Yaezhing for divine justice to be doled out by his hand. Most people and gods are wary of Yaezhing, seeing him as a necessary evil at best and a force of murderous destruction at worst. Yaezhing doesn't see a need to clear up any misunderstandings, the same way that a sword or shuriken doesn't need to explain itself to the people who wield them.\n\n Despite his gruesome title and task, Yaezhing does not partake in wanton murder. In his eyes, the act of killing is not done for pleasure or glory, but to fulfill a binding agreement that has been made between executioner and law or assassin and client. Once the contract is made and the payment is finalized, it becomes the sole duty of Yaezhing and his followers to bring about the death of the target.\n\n Yaezhing doesn't concern himself with determining who is guilty and who should live or die. For him, there is no difference between legally approved executions and contracted assassinations. They are simply two sides of the same coin, where death is the greatest equalizer, and Yaezhing is duty-bound to be its wielder and weapon.\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**Category** [Tian Gods](/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=16)\r\n\r\n**Edicts** commit assassinations for hire, strike unseen, carry out punishment for convicted criminals\r\n\r\n**Anathema** show mercy to a target, take credit for your assassinations, refuse to punish a lawfully convicted criminal, slaughter indiscriminately\r\n\r\n**Area of Concern**\r\nharsh justice, murder, punishment\n\n</column>\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n</row>\r\n<title level=\"2\">Devotee Benefits</title>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"tiny\">\r\n\r\n**[Divine Attribute](/Backgrounds.aspx?ID=132)**\r\nDexterity or Intelligence\r\n\r\n**Divine Font** [Harm](/Spells.aspx?ID=146)\r\n\r\n**Divine Sanctification** can choose holy or unholy\r\n\r\n**Divine Skill** [Stealth](/Skills.aspx?ID=48)\r\n\r\n**Favored Weapon** [Shuriken](/Weapons.aspx?ID=439)\r\n\r\n**Domains** [Death](/Domains.aspx?ID=70), [Duty](/Domains.aspx?ID=45), [Pain](/Domains.aspx?ID=87), [Trickery](/Domains.aspx?ID=94)\r\n\r\n**[Alternate Domains](/Rules.aspx?ID=802)** [Darkness](/Domains.aspx?ID=69)\r\n\r\n**Cleric Spells**\n\n- **1st**\r\n[Sure Strike](/Spells.aspx?ID=1709)\n\n- **2nd**\r\n[Invisibility](/Spells.aspx?ID=1577)\n\n- **6th**\r\n[Mislead](/Spells.aspx?ID=1605)\n\n</column>","search_text":" yaezhing (the minister of blood) source tian xia world guide pg. 44 when the gods of the celestial court were given their divine duties, it was yaezhing who was assigned the title of minister of blood, the punisher of the gods, and the enforcer of divine justice. when fumeiyoshi was found guilty of murdering his brother tsukiyo, it was yaezhing who was tasked with burying him alive and making an example of those who would cross the court. when assassins and executioners are hired to carry out capital punishments, it is yaezhing who they pray to for a steady hand and the conviction to follow through. as the god of assassins and executioners, yaezhing oversees contracted death and guides those who are tasked with the duty of killing others. he is also seen as a figure of justice, meting out bloody punishment to all who deserve it, whether godly or mortal. judges and constables pray to him for criminals to be convicted and given the harshest sentences. those who have been wronged by the corrupt courts of mortals beg yaezhing for divine justice to be doled out by his hand. most people and gods are wary of yaezhing, seeing him as a necessary evil at best and a force of murderous destruction at worst. yaezhing doesn't see a need to clear up any misunderstandings, the same way that a sword or shuriken doesn't need to explain itself to the people who wield them. despite his gruesome title and task, yaezhing does not partake in wanton murder. in his eyes, the act of killing is not done for pleasure or glory, but to fulfill a binding agreement that has been made between executioner and law or assassin and client. once the contract is made and the payment is finalized, it becomes the sole duty of yaezhing and his followers to bring about the death of the target. yaezhing doesn't concern himself with determining who is guilty and who should live or die. for him, there is no difference between legally approved executions and contracted assassinations. they are simply two sides of the same coin, where death is the greatest equalizer, and yaezhing is duty-bound to be its wielder and weapon. category tian gods edicts commit assassinations for hire, strike unseen, carry out punishment for convicted criminals anathema show mercy to a target, take credit for your assassinations, refuse to punish a lawfully convicted criminal, slaughter indiscriminately area of concern harsh justice, murder, punishment devotee benefits divine attribute dexterity or intelligence divine font harm divine sanctification can choose holy or unholy divine skill stealth favored weapon shuriken domains death, duty, pain, trickery alternate domains darkness cleric spells -

From these vantage points, he can easily observe his followers work the land and set up temples and shrines to his glory on the numerous peaks that crisscross the world. At times when he is displeased at how his people have misused the fertile valleys, fed by mountain streams, Yamatsumi will remind his followers of his wrath with a minor avalanche or a belch of dark smoke from a volcano. His followers once failed to heed such warnings, and Yamatsumi caused Mount Kumijinja in Minkai to erupt mightily to demonstrate his anger, covering the continent in ash, and darkening the skies for months. While a horrific event, the tremendous heat melted the glaciers on the mountain, further feeding the rivers running through the green valleys, and the ash from the eruption provided fine fertilizer for the earth below. As such, once his wrath was satiated, the land again began to renew and grow back even more fruitful than before. Some fear such eruptions might herald a repeat of the catastrophes that caused the Age of Ashes almost 10,000 years ago, though Yamatsumi has vowed not to allow his wrath to extend that deep.

Should such followers falter altogether, Yamatsumi preserves them where they fall in solid ice, a monument to their courage.\n\n Priests of the Mountain Lord eschew the comforts of civilization for a life of asceticism. They seek tall peaks to build simple dwellings and sturdy temples for worship. From their lofty positions among the mountaintops, they take in the grandeur of nature, and their solitude enables them to see the pettiness of the dealings far below.

Yet a divine argument between him and his sister [Shelyn](/Deities.aspx?ID=17) resulted in the god departing for parts unknown.

No one knows what he found in that place, but he returned—changed, but claiming to be strengthened by what he had endured.

Source Gods &amp; Magic pg. 51 2.0 Minor Boon The Midnight Lord turns your blood and pain into chains of midnight darkness to destroy your foes. Once, for 1 minute, whenever you take slashing, piercing, or bleed damage, chains rip forth from your body, affecting creatures in a line from your position in the direction of the attack (or in the direction of your choice for bleed damage or if you deal the damage yourself) with the effect of a grim tendrils spell whose level is equal to half your level rounded up, and whose DC is your highest spell DC (or 10 + your level + your Wisdom modifier if you have no spell DC). Moderate Boon Each morning, during your daily preparations, scars gather into words on your flesh. The scars function as a scroll of a divine spell of Zon- Kuthon’s choosing. After you use the scroll or receive magical healing, the boon fades for the day, though some or all of the scars might remain as a reminder. Major Boon Shadows are deeper around you. Darkvision and greater darkvision cannot penetrate darkness within 60 feet of you, but you can see through it normally. Minor Curse You are surrounded by spectral chains that cause you to always be encumbered and that have the same effects as armor with the noisy trait. Moderate Curse You share the pain of others, and even minor wounds bring you incredible pain. Whenever you see (or otherwise sense) a creature take damage, you take 1d6 mental damage. Whenever you take damage any other way than from the first part of this curse, you take 1d6 mental damage from increased pain and are sickened 1.
