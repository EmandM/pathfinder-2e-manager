If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemy</title>\r\nYou understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.\n\n You gain the [Alchemical Crafting](/Feats.aspx?ID=5117) feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Formula Book</title> An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [formula book](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2724) for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level [alchemical items](/Equipment.aspx?Category=6) of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. \n\nEach time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the [Inventor](/Feats.aspx?ID=5164) skill feat so you can invent them .\n\n As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Advanced Alchemy</title> During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Versatile Vials</title> You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.\n\n Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.\n\n You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Quick Alchemy</title> You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly.  \n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-2801\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Research Field</title>\r\nYour inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up.\n\nResearch fields can be found [here](ResearchFields.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Alchemist Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an [alchemist class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=812).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Field Discovery</title>\r\nYou learn a discovery listed in your research field\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Powerful Alchemy</title>\r\nAlchemical items you infuse are particularly potent. When you create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Alchemical Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve trained to more effectively wield the weapons you find in your lab. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, alchemical bombs, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Will Expertise</title>\r\nYour mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for will saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Alchemical Expertise</title>\r\nConstant practice has increased the effectiveness of your concoctions. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to expert. In addition, when you gather reagents during exploration mode, you can regain three vials instead of two.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Double Brew</title>\r\nYou know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the Quick Alchemy action, you can create two items. These items don’t have to be the same. If you create two consumables, you have to expend a versatile vial for each one.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Advanced Vials</title>\r\nYour experience helps you improve your field vials with a benefit particular to your research field.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Chemical Hardiness</title>\r\nImbibing alchemical compounds has strengthened your organs. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Greater Field Discovery</title>\r\nYou learn an incredible discovery that advances your understanding of your field, as described in your research field.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Alchemical Weapon Mastery</title>\r\nYou’ve mastered full capability with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, alchemical bombs, and unarmed attacks increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Explosion Dodger</title>\r\nYour experiments taught you to fling yourself out of the way of sudden explosions. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Abundant Vials</title>\r\nYou’re permanently quickened, and can use the extra action only to use Quick Alchemy to create a quick vial. You can create only one vial with this action, even if you have double brew or a similar ability.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Alchemical Mastery</title>\r\nYour concoctions are incredibly effective. Your proficiency rank for your alchemist class DC increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Medium Armor Mastery</title>\r\nYour skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows.

You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits. Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many alchemist class features and abilities. Additive: Feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable (you can't use additives with quick vials). You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to. Coagulant: Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time.

Infused: An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. Sample Formula Book You can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas. A beginner's book with these formulas called The Fundamentals of Alchemy has become popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling alchemists away from more innovative experiments. Alchemical Item Formulas : Alchemist's fire, frost vial, cheetah's elixir, elixir of life, glue bomb, smoke ball; Bomber Acid flask, bottled lightning; Chirurgeon Antidote, antiplague; Mutagenist Bestial mutagen, cognitive mutagen; Toxicologist Arsenic, giant centipede venom Roleplaying the Alchemist During Combat Encounters... You lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. You might even use mutagens to warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases. While Exploring... You keep an eye out for additional ingredients that you can turn into alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious. In Downtime... You experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge. You Might... Enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause. Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt. Endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools. Others Probably... Think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception. Don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention. Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Alchemy You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science. You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. Formula Book An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard formula book for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field. Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the Inventor skill feat so you can invent them . As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life. Advanced Alchemy During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Versatile Vials You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents.

You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way. Quick Alchemy You gain the Quick Alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly. Research Field Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up. Research fields can be found here. Alchemist Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.

hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits. key attribute: intelligence at 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to intelligence. hit points: 8 plus your constitution modifier you increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms you'll see the following key terms in many alchemist class features and abilities. additive: feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use quick alchemy to create a consumable (you can't use additives with quick vials). you can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to. coagulant: healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time. if a creature heals hit points from an item with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily immune to healing hit points from subsequent items with the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those items). infused: an alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again. sample formula book you can choose any 1st-level common alchemical items for your formula book, but the list below contains a good selection of starter formulas. a beginner's book with these formulas called the fundamentals of alchemy has become popular among mainstream alchemists by staying away from controversial topics like mutagens, though it has drawn criticism from fringe alchemists for guiding fledgling alchemists away from more innovative experiments. alchemical item formulas : alchemist's fire, frost vial, cheetah's elixir, elixir of life, glue bomb, smoke ball; bomber acid flask, bottled lightning; chirurgeon antidote, antiplague; mutagenist bestial mutagen, cognitive mutagen; toxicologist arsenic, giant centipede venom roleplaying the alchemist during combat encounters... you lob bombs at your foes, harry your enemies, and support the rest of your party with potent elixirs. you might even use mutagens to warp your body into a resilient and powerful weapon. during social encounters... you provide knowledge and experience about alchemical items and related secrets, such as poisons and diseases. while exploring... you keep an eye out for additional ingredients that you can turn into alchemical reagents, while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious. in downtime... you experiment in an alchemical lab, brewing elixirs, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge. you might... enjoy tinkering with strange formulas and alchemical reagents, often with a single-minded dedication and recklessness that gives others pause. get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctions you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt. endlessly experiment to discover new, more potent alchemical tools. others probably... think you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you don't cast spells; spellcasters who clumsily dabble in alchemy only heighten this misconception. don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention. assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. you are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. perception trained in perception saving throws

your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. alchemy you understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. you can do this using normal reagents and the craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science. you gain the alchemical crafting feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for. formula book an alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. you start with a standard formula book for free. the formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from alchemical crafting and your research field. each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. these new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. you learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the inventor skill feat so you can invent them . as normal, having the base formula is sufficient when crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. for instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life. advanced alchemy during your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. you don't need to attempt a crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. you can craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your intelligence modifier. each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. these items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. versatile vials you know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. during your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. if you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. for every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities. versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. a vial you create is always the highest type you could craft. see the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. you can also use vials for quick alchemy (see below) and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial. you can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its bulk. though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way. quick alchemy you gain the quick alchemy action to make the items you need on the fly. research field your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. at 1st level, you choose your research field. this choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up. research fields can be found here. alchemist feats at 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an alchemist class feat. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and

and the spiritual. You bond with spirits, manifesting their distinct magic and allowing their knowledge to flow through you. You may favor apparitions that grant you healing magic, others that grant you spells of destructive power, or pick and choose between different apparitions as your environment and circumstances demand. You may consider your powers part of a sacred trust or see your unique abilities as a sign that you've been chosen as a champion of two worlds.

Unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. Apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and with things; they generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. Animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so.\n\n Animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. You must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their Requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to. Typically, you're assumed to always attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, but in some rare circumstances or as a result of certain animist abilities, your apparitions might be dispersed or separated from you for a time. You aren't attuned to dispersed apparitions. **[Wandering](/Traits.aspx?ID=843)**: Wandering is a new trait that identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. These feats may require you to be attuned to an apparition who matches their requirements when you select them and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. When you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). You must meet all the new feat's other prerequisites. In addition, the animist makes use of the stance trait, reprinted below for convenience:\n\n **[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=701)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Animist</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou channel the power of spiritual entities called apparitions to cast potent spells and manipulate the battlefield to your advantage. You mix divine magic and the spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies or sustain your allies.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Social Encounters...</title>\r\nYou watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you toward sound judgment.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">While Exploring...</title>\r\nYou use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or to notice hidden treasures that others might pass by.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">In Downtime...</title>\r\nYou seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort.

and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that\r\nrepresent your basic training. These proficiencies are\r\nnoted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Apparition Attunement</title>\r\nAnimists have a gift for divine magic that allows them to serve as conduits or bridges for otherworldly spiritual entities known collectively as apparitions; through them, these entities can commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. Apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations that have grown thought and purpose over time, or they may be a different variation altogether. Some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming deep partnerships over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist's journey takes them.\n\n Each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitionsto attune to. Of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. Your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of [Lore](/Skills.aspx?ID=41) skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique [_avatar_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1446) form.\n\n When you [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=2621), you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. All your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. If an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its gifts—you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you can't use its vessel spell or _avatar_ form—until you attune to it again. When you disperse your primary apparition, one of your remaining apparitions becomes your primary apparition, chosen by you at the time of dispersal.\n\n See [Animist Apparitions](Apparitions.aspx) for more information.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Animist &amp; Apparition Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour role as a spiritual medium connecting the mortal Universe to the realms beyond lets you cast your magic in two distinct ways: you both learn and prepare spells from the divine tradition yourself, and you also channel the knowledge and power of your attuned apparitions, gaining spell slots and a repertoire of spells from them that you can cast spontaneously.\n\n Regardless of which source you're drawing on, you are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an animist, your incantations might take the form of reciting relevant snippets of legends—stories passed down orally—or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows. Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.\n\n The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can't cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versa— your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Animist Spellcasting</title> As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new techniques and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Animist Spells per Day.\n\n You are a prepared spellcaster for the purposes of determining how you interact with staves and other items or effects that differentiate between prepared and spontaneous spellcasters. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Apparition Spellcasting</title> You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way. As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Vessel Spells</title> Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can't cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained it (for example, an animist who has cast earth's bile during their turn can't then cast or Sustain another instance of earth's bile during that same turn).\n\n It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or tell a story.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, though certain feats or abilities adjust this number, but it can never be more than 3 points.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Animistic Practice</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you choose an [animistic practice](Practices.aspx) that influences the way your power grows and develops, and you gain its first invocation. At 9th level, you gain its second invocation, and at 17th, you gain its third.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Animist Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain an animist class feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Fortitude Expertise</title>\r\nSpiritual energy reinforces your body, making you more resilient. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nThe magic of the spirits flows freely through you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Third Apparition</title>\r\nYou've learned to shelter more spirits, gaining access to more magic. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose three apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYour apparitions call attention to minute details you might otherwise overlook. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Expert Protections</title>\r\nThe spiritual entities that protect you warn you of harm before it would occur, giving you more time to react, and help bear the burden of your armor when it is necessary. Your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, unarmored defense, and Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Simple Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nTraining and magical assistance from your spiritual companions have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Master of Mind and Spirit</title>\r\nYour apparitions gird your mind against hostile intrusion and shield you from the effects of entities seeking to control your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Fourth Apparition</title>\r\nYou're truly loved by the spirits, with apparitions flocking to you from far and wide. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose four apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour affinity with the apparitions you bond to has further enhanced the potency of your magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou are a near-perfect channel for the magical energies of the realms beyond. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Supreme Incarnation</title>\r\nYou become a nexus between the mortal and spiritual realms through which your apparition can embody its full might. You gain a 10th-rank apparition spell slot. In addition to heightened versions of your apparition spells, you can use this slot to cast [_avatar_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1446). When you cast _avatar_ in this way, you do not become an avatar of a deity; rather, your primary attuned apparition incarnates itself using your body, transforming you into the avatar described in your primary attuned apparition's entry.","name":"Animist","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/animist"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/animist/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/animist/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/animist/class-kit"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"War of Immortals","primary_source_raw":"War of Immortals pg. 10","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2024-10-30","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 10\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nAnimists gain magical spells from spirits called apparitions that they attune to, choosing new apparitions as the circumstances demand.\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"skill_proficiency":["Trained in  Religion  and either  Nature  or  Occultism","Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier"],"source":["War of Immortals"],"source_raw":["War of Immortals pg. 10"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 10","speed":{},"summary":"Animists gain magical spells from spirits called apparitions that they attune to, choosing new apparitions as the circumstances demand.","summary_markdown":"Animists gain magical spells from spirits called apparitions that they attune to, choosing new apparitions as the circumstances demand.","text":" Animist Source War of Immortals pg. 10 You are the interlocutor between the seen and unseen, the voice that connects the mortal and the spiritual. You bond with spirits, manifesting their distinct magic and allowing their knowledge to flow through you. You may favor apparitions that grant you healing magic, others that grant you spells of destructive power, or pick and choose between different apparitions as your environment and circumstances demand. You may consider your powers part of a sacred trust or see your unique abilities as a sign that you've been chosen as a champion of two worlds. Whether you advocate for mortals in the planes beyond or whether you represent the spirits' interests, you provide the bridge between realms. Key Attribute: Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following new key terms in many animist class features. Apparition : Apparitions are spiritual entities who generally lack the power, cohesiveness, or attachments to enter or affect the physical world. Unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. Apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and with things; they generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. Animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so. Animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. You must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their Requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to. Typically, you're assumed to always attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, but in some rare circumstances or as a result of certain animist abilities, your apparitions might be dispersed or separated from you for a time. You aren't attuned to dispersed apparitions. Wandering : Wandering is a new trait that identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. These feats may require you to be attuned to an apparition who matches their requirements when you select them and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. When you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). You must meet all the new feat's other prerequisites. In addition, the animist makes use of the stance trait, reprinted below for convenience: Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. Roleplaying the Animist During Combat Encounters... You channel the power of spiritual entities called apparitions to cast potent spells and manipulate the battlefield to your advantage. You mix divine magic and the spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies or sustain your allies. During Social Encounters... You watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you toward sound judgment. While Exploring... You use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or to notice hidden treasures that others might pass by. In Downtime... You seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort. You might tend to grave sites, tread primeval wildernesses, or ride the rivers and seas. Animists attuned to apparitions of wisdom and knowledge may spend their quiet hours in libraries or temples. You Might... Talk to spiritual entities only you can perceive. Prefer to speak in stories and descriptive anecdotes. Look at the world from a broader or more metaphorical perspective than most mortal creatures. Others Probably... Find you detached or absent-minded due to your focus on things beyond their awareness. Value your wisdom as someone with access to vast troves of experience beyond what a single person could normally accumulate. Mistake you for being cruel or lacking empathy because you give equal weight to the material and immaterial.

For instance, a 2nd-level animist has “2+1” 1st-rank spell slots, meaning they can prepare two 1st-rank spells via animist spellcasting, and they also have one spell slot to spontaneously cast an apparition spell. The supreme apparition class feature gives you a 10th-rank apparition slot that works a bit differently from other spells. Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Apparition Attunement Animists have a gift for divine magic that allows them to serve as conduits or bridges for otherworldly spiritual entities known collectively as apparitions; through them, these entities can commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. Apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations that have grown thought and purpose over time, or they may be a different variation altogether. Some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming deep partnerships over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist's journey takes them. Each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitionsto attune to. Of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. Your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of Lore skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique avatar form. When you Refocus, you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. All your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. If an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its gifts—you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you can't use its vessel spell or avatar form—until you attune to it again. When you disperse your primary apparition, one of your remaining apparitions becomes your primary apparition, chosen by you at the time of dispersal. See Animist Apparitions for more information. Animist &amp; Apparition Spellcasting Your role as a spiritual medium connecting the mortal Universe to the realms beyond lets you cast your magic in two distinct ways: you both learn and prepare spells from the divine tradition yourself, and you also channel the knowledge and power of your attuned apparitions, gaining spell slots and a repertoire of spells from them that you can cast spontaneously. Regardless of which source you're drawing on, you are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an animist, your incantations might take the form of reciting relevant snippets of legends—stories passed down orally—or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows. Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. The clearly delineated partnership between an animist and their apparitions means you can't cast your animist spells using your apparition spell slots or vice versa— your magics remain complementary and harmonious, yet as distinct as the two worlds from which they come. Animist Spellcasting As a keeper of knowledge, you are constantly learning new techniques and spells. Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an animist, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Animist Spells per Day. You are a prepared spellcaster for the purposes of determining how you interact with staves and other items or effects that differentiate between prepared and spontaneous spellcasters. Apparition Spellcasting You can draw upon your attuned apparitions as a second source of magical knowledge and power. You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you cast them this way. As you increase in level, you gain further apparition spell slots, and your apparitions grant you higher-rank apparition spells, as detailed in each apparition entry. Heightening Spells When you gain spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of animist spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level animist, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level animist, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Vessel Spells Your primary attuned apparition can use your body as a conduit, allowing you to cast a unique vessel spell. Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can't cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained it (for example, an animist who has cast earth's bile during their turn can't then cast or Sustain another instance of earth's bile during that same turn). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to treat with nearby spirits, meditate on resolving an issue pertaining to the balance of spirits and mortals, or tell a story. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, though certain feats or abilities adjust this number, but it can never be more than 3 points. Animistic Practice At 1st level, you choose an animistic practice that influences the way your power grows and develops, and you gain its first invocation. At 9th level, you gain its second invocation, and at 17th, you gain its third. Animist Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain an animist class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Fortitude Expertise Spiritual energy reinforces your body, making you more resilient. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Expert Spellcaster The magic of the spirits flows freely through you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Third Apparition You've learned to shelter more spirits, gaining access to more magic. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose three apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3). Perception Expertise Your apparitions call attention to minute details you might otherwise overlook. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Expert Protections The spiritual entities that protect you warn you of harm before it would occur, giving you more time to react, and help bear the burden of your armor when it is necessary. Your proficiency rank for light armor, medium armor, unarmored defense, and Reflex saves increases to expert. Simple Weapon Expertise Training and magical assistance from your spiritual companions have improved your weapon technique. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Master of Mind and Spirit Your apparitions gird your mind against hostile intrusion and shield you from the effects of entities seeking to control your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary Fourth Apparition You're truly loved by the spirits, with apparitions flocking to you from far and wide. When you attune to apparitions during your daily preparations, you choose four apparitions to attune to, with one of them being your primary apparition. The number of Focus Points in your focus pool increases by 1 (maximum 3). Master Spellcaster Your affinity with the apparitions you bond to has further enhanced the potency of your magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master. Legendary Spellcaster You are a near-perfect channel for the magical energies of the realms beyond. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary. Supreme Incarnation You become a nexus between the mortal and spiritual realms through which your apparition can embody its full might. You gain a 10th-rank apparition spell slot. In addition to heightened versions of your apparition spells, you can use this slot to cast avatar . When you cast avatar in this way, you do not become an avatar of a deity; rather, your primary attuned apparition incarnates itself using your body, transforming you into the avatar described in your primary attuned apparition's entry.","tradition_markdown":"","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=64","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Animist](/Classes.aspx?ID=64)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [War of Immortals](/Sources.aspx?ID=232) pg. 10\n\n_You are the interlocutor between the seen and unseen, the voice that connects the mortal and the spiritual.

see the following new key terms in many animist class features. apparition : apparitions are spiritual entities who generally lack the power, cohesiveness, or attachments to enter or affect the physical world. unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and with things; they generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so. animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. you must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to. typically, you're assumed to always attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, but in some rare circumstances or as a result of certain animist abilities, your apparitions might be dispersed or separated from you for a time. you aren't attuned to dispersed apparitions. wandering : wandering is a new trait that identifies animist feats attuned to particular types of apparitions. these feats may require you to be attuned to an apparition who matches their requirements when you select them and represent knowledge and ability pulled from that specific bond. when you make your daily preparations, you can retrain any wandering feat you know for any other wandering feat available at the level you took the exchanged feat (including lower-level wandering feats, as usual). you must meet all the new feat's other prerequisites. in addition, the animist makes use of the stance trait, reprinted below for convenience: stance : a stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. a stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. after you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. you can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. you can dismiss a stance. roleplaying the animist during combat encounters... you channel the power of spiritual entities called apparitions to cast potent spells and manipulate the battlefield to your advantage. you mix divine magic and the spells granted to you by your attuned apparitions to cast down your enemies or sustain your allies. during social encounters... you watch and listen, letting the whispers of spirits and otherworldly beings guide you toward sound judgment. while exploring... you use your patient attention to detail, alongside clues and special senses gifted to you by your spiritual allies, to detect threats before they can ambush your companions or to notice hidden treasures that others might pass by. in downtime... you seek out areas close to otherworldly entities who bring you strength or comfort. you might tend to grave sites, tread primeval wildernesses, or ride the rivers and seas. animists attuned to apparitions of wisdom and knowledge may spend their quiet hours in libraries or temples. you might... talk to spiritual entities only you can perceive. prefer to speak in stories and descriptive anecdotes. look at the world from a broader or more metaphorical perspective than most mortal creatures. others probably... find you detached or absent-minded due to your focus on things beyond their awareness. value your wisdom as someone with access to vast troves of experience beyond what a single person could normally accumulate. mistake you for being cruel or lacking empathy because you give equal weight to the material and immaterial. initial

2+2 2+2 2+2 2+2 2+2 2+2 2+2 2+1 the number before a plus sign indicates your spell slots via animist spellcasting, and the number after it indicates your spell slots from apparition spellcasting. for instance, a 2nd-level animist has “2+1” 1st-rank spell slots, meaning they can prepare two 1st-rank spells via animist spellcasting, and they also have one spell slot to spontaneously cast an apparition spell. the supreme apparition class feature gives you a 10th-rank apparition slot that works a bit differently from other spells. ancestry and background in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. apparition attunement animists have a gift for divine magic that allows them to serve as conduits or bridges for otherworldly spiritual entities known collectively as apparitions; through them, these entities can commune and interact with the physical world in a process called attunement. apparitions are myriad and diverse: they may be human spirits lingering on the border between becoming phantoms or ghosts, animal spirits with particularly strong connections to the physical world but lacking the malice that would spur a transition into true undeath, manifestations of natural locations that have grown thought and purpose over time, or they may be a different variation altogether. some animists attune to one or more specific apparitions that accompany them in their travels, forming deep partnerships over time, while others adapt to their surroundings by befriending the local apparitions who dwell wherever the animist's journey takes them. each day during your daily preparations, choose two apparitionsto attune to. of these, choose one to be your primary apparition. your attuned apparitions each grant you knowledge in the form of lore skills and a repertoire of additional spells you can cast using apparition spellcasting (see below), and your primary apparition grants you even further power in the form a unique vessel focus spell and, when you are higher level, a unique avatar form. when you refocus, you can change which of your currently attuned apparitions is your primary apparition, selecting from any of the apparitions you attuned to during your daily preparations. all your apparitions typically remain attuned to you until your next daily preparations, but some animist abilities can temporarily disperse them, usually in exchange for a powerful boon. if an apparition is dispersed, you lose access to its gifts—you forget its apparition skills, its spells are removed from your apparition spell repertoire, and you can't use its vessel spell or avatar form—until you attune to it again. when you disperse your primary apparition, one of your remaining apparitions becomes your primary apparition, chosen by you at the time of dispersal. see animist apparitions for more information. animist &amp; apparition spellcasting your role as a spiritual medium connecting the mortal universe to the realms beyond lets you cast your magic in two distinct ways: you both learn and prepare spells from the divine tradition yourself, and you also channel the knowledge and power of your attuned apparitions, gaining spell slots and a repertoire of spells from them that you can cast spontaneously. regardless of which source you're drawing on, you are a

maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will any number

You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most. Key Attribute: Strength At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Strength. Hit Points: 12 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many barbarian class features. Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Rage: You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging. Roleplaying the Barbarian During Combat Encounters... You summon your rage and rush to the front lines to smash your way through. Offense is your best defense—you'll need to drop foes before they can exploit your relatively low defenses. During Social Encounters... You use intimidation to get what you need, especially when gentler persuasion can't get the job done. While Exploring... You look out for danger, ready to charge headfirst into battle in an instant. You climb the challenging rock wall and drop a rope for others to follow, and you wade into the risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water's surface. If something needs breaking, you're up to the task! In Downtime... You might head to a tavern to carouse, build up the fearsome legend of your mighty deeds, or recruit followers to become a warlord in your own right. You Might... Have a deep-seated well of anger, hatred, or frustration. Prefer a straightforward approach to one requiring patience and tedium. Engage in a regimen of intense physical fitness. Others Probably... Rely on your courage and your strength, and trust that you can hold your own in a fight. See you as uncivilized or a boorish lout unfit for high society. Believe that you are loyal to your friends and allies and will never relent until the fight is done.

If the spell requires an auditory performance, you might recite a poem, sing a song, or perform a dramatic monologue. If the spell requires a visual performance, you might dance or pantomime. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.\n\n**[Spellshape](/Traits.aspx?ID=513):** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Bard</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies.

Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. These are described in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Bard Spellcasting</title>\r\nYou draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument.\n\n Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are [heightened](/Rules.aspx?ID=273) to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the [occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3) list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Bard Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during [downtime](/Rules.aspx?ID=2447).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Composition Spells</title>\r\nYou can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\n\n You learn the [_counter performance_](/Spells.aspx?ID=381) composition spell, protecting against [auditory](/Traits.aspx?ID=16) and [visual](/Traits.aspx?ID=163) effects. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Composition Cantrips</title> Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with bard spellcasting. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=2447).\n\n You learn the [_courageous anthem_](/Spells.aspx?ID=386) composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against [fear](/Traits.aspx?ID=68).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Muses</title>\r\nAs a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things and might be someone you know, a supernatural creature, location, deity, philosophy, or captivating mystery. Depending on the type of inspiration you receive, your 1st-level muse grants you a specific 1st-level bard feat and adds a spell to your repertoire.\n\n In addition to this, each muse opens the door to many later bard feats. If one type of inspiration is not enough to represent your muse, consider the [Multifarious Muse](/Feats.aspx?ID=187) feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Bard Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [bard class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=19).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Traits.aspx?ID=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Traits.aspx?ID=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYou've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nExperience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour magical techniques grow stronger. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Fortitude Expertise</title>\r\nYour physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Performer's Heart</title>\r\nThe greatest performances require an understanding of your own mind and flawless concentration. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Bard Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the [critical specialization effect](/Rules.aspx?ID=235) for that weapon or unarmed attack.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Mastery</title>\r\nYou've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou pluck the threads of magic like the strings of a harp. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Greater Performer's Heart</title>\r\nYour performances warp the mind and cause emotions to flower, and understanding how to do this also forges an incomparable understanding of your own mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Magnum Opus</title>\r\nYou have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells using bard spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Perfect Encore](/Feats.aspx?ID=212) feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour command of magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.","name":"Bard","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/bard"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/bard/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/bard/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/bard/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/bard/focus-spells"},{"label":"Muses","url":"/classes/bard/muses"}],"perception_proficiency":"Expert","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 94","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 94 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nAn artist and a scholar, the bard uses performance and esoteric learning to bolster their companions and foil their enemies.

Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many bard class features. Composition: To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you use a type of Performance. If the spell requires an auditory performance, you might recite a poem, sing a song, or perform a dramatic monologue. If the spell requires a visual performance, you might dance or pantomime. You can cast only one composition spell each turn, and you can have only one active at a time. If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Bard During Combat Encounters... You use magical performances to alter the odds in favor of your allies. You confidently alternate between attacks, healing, and helpful spells as needed. During Social Encounters... You persuade, prevaricate, and threaten with ease. While Exploring... You’re a font of knowledge, folktales, legends, and lore that provide a deeper context and helpful reconnaissance for the group’s adventure. Your spells and performances inspire your allies to greater discovery and success. In Downtime... You can earn money and prestige with your performances, gaining a name for yourself and acquiring patrons. Eventually, tales of your talents and triumphs might attract other bards to study your techniques in a bardic college. You Might... Have a passion for your art so strong that you forge a spiritual connection with it. Take point when tact and nonviolent solutions are required. Follow your muse, whether it’s a mysterious fey creature, a philosophical concept, a psychic force, or a deity of art or music, and with its aid learn secret lore that few others have. Others Probably... Relish the opportunity to invite you to social events, either as a performer or a guest, but consider you to be something of a curiosity in their social circles. Underestimate you compared to other spellcasters, believing you are little more than a foppish minstrel and overlooking the subtle power of your magic. Respond favorably to your social charm and abilities, but remain suspicious of your beguiling magic. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. These are described in Chapter 2. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Bard Spellcasting You draw upon magic from esoteric knowledge. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the occult tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument. Each day, you can cast up to two 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a bard, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Bard Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of bard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level bard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level bard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank occult spells of your choice and five occult cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the occult list or from other occult spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Bard Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Composition Spells You can infuse your performances with magic to create unique effects called compositions. Compositions are a special type of spell that often require you to use the Performance skill when casting them. Composition spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. You learn the counter performance composition spell, protecting against auditory and visual effects. Composition Cantrips Composition cantrips are special composition spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. Composition cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with bard spellcasting. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out composition cantrips gained from bard feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. You learn the courageous anthem composition cantrip, which boosts your allies' attacks, damage, and defense against fear. Muses As a bard, you select one muse at 1st level. This muse leads you to great things and might be someone you know, a supernatural creature, location, deity, philosophy, or captivating mystery. Depending on the type of inspiration you receive, your 1st-level muse grants you a specific 1st-level bard feat and adds a spell to your repertoire. In addition to this, each muse opens the door to many later bard feats. If one type of inspiration is not enough to represent your muse, consider the Multifarious Muse feat. Bard Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a bard class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Reflex Expertise You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Signature Spells Experience allows you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. Expert Spellcaster Your magical techniques grow stronger. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to expert. Fortitude Expertise Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Performer's Heart The greatest performances require an understanding of your own mind and flawless concentration. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Bard Weapon Expertise You have become thoroughly adept with bardic weapons. Your proficiency rank for martial weapons, simple weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. When you critically succeed at an attack roll using one of these weapons or an unarmed attack while one of your compositions is active, you apply the critical specialization effect for that weapon or unarmed attack. Perception Mastery You've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. Light Armor Expertise You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You pluck the threads of magic like the strings of a harp. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master. Greater Performer's Heart Your performances warp the mind and cause emotions to flower, and understanding how to do this also forges an incomparable understanding of your own mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage. Magnum Opus You have tuned your spellcasting to the highest caliber. Add two common 10th-rank occult spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells using bard spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Perfect Encore feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster Your command of magic is the stuff of legends. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.","tradition":["Occult"],"tradition_markdown":"[Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3)","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=32","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Bard](/Classes.aspx?ID=32)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 94 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n_You are a master of artistry, a scholar of hidden secrets, and a captivating persuader.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Deity</title>\r\nAs a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity you revere above all others. TThe most common [deities](Deities.aspx) in Pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one [deity](Deities.aspx). \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Skill</title> You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Anathema</title>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.\n\n Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.\n\n Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.\n\n If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=108) ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Sanctification</title> Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you [holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) or [unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521). This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.\n\n If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you _atone_.\n\n Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options. **Holy:** You gain the [holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them” and the anathema “Commit murder.” Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder [baseline](/Rules.aspx?ID=2265), the acts listed there are anathema to you. **Unholy:** You gain the [unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521) trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity” and the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.” None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Deific Weapon</title> You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain access to it, and if it's an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Champion's Aura</title> You're surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the [aura](/Traits.aspx?ID=542) and [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579) traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you're a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion's reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=561) trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Cause</title>\r\nYou devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name. Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction.\n\nCauses can be found [here](Causes.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Devotion Spells</title>\r\nYour deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose either [_shields of the spirit_](/Spells.aspx?ID=2049) or a spell based on your deity's divine font ([_lay on hands_](/Spells.aspx?ID=2047) if your deity allows heal, [_touch of the void_](/Spells.aspx?ID=2048) if your deity allows harm).\n\n It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=2621) activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.\n\n Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.\n\n [Focus spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228) are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Champion Feats</title>\r\nAt 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a [champion class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=811).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Shield Block</title>\r\nYou gain the [Shield Block](/Feats.aspx?ID=5212) general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Blessing of the Devoted</title>\r\nYour deity blesses your service with a boon. This might come in the form of a spirit that visits you and inhabits your items or body, a mysterious divine tattoo upon your body, or the like. Choose one of the following blessings, or any other to which you have access.\n\n **Blessed Armament:** Select one weapon or [handwraps of mighty blows](/Equipment.aspx?ID=3086). You gain that armament's critical specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list: [fearsome](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2837), [ghost touch](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840), [returning](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2845), [shifting](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2846), or [vitalizing](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2852). During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both.\n\n **Blessed Shield:** In your hands, a shield gains the minor [_reinforcing_](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2811) rune. As you go up in level, the shield gains the _reinforcing_ rune of your level (lesser at 7th level, moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at 16th level, and supreme at 19th level). If your shield already has the appropriate _reinforcing_ rune for your level, or if it's a [sturdy shield](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2828) of the same level as the appropriate _reinforcing_ rune, the shield's Hardness instead increases by 1.\n\n **Blessed Swiftness:** You gain a +5-foot status bonus to Speed. If you're mounted, your mount gains the bonus instead. In addition, when the movement of one of your allies triggers an enemy's reaction while the ally is in your champion's aura, the ally gains a +2 status bonus to all defenses against that reaction.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.\n\nAt 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you’re already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you’re already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Champion Expertise</title>\r\nPrayers strengthen your divine power. Your proficiency ranks for your champion class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Relentless Reaction</title>\r\nYour champion’s reaction improves, typically to punish the attacker with spiritual backlash. It gainsthe relentless reaction benefit listed in your cause below your champion’s reaction.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Sacred Body</title>\r\nThe power of your deity keeps your body safe from harm, as true an edifice of the faith as a great temple. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Divine Will</title>\r\nYour faith grants mastery of your will. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Exalted Reaction</title>\r\nYour champion’s reaction exalts nearby allies, allowing them to benefit as well. When you use your champion’s reaction, you also get the effect listed for its exalted reaction.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you.

You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as divine power you use to end the threats your deity opposes. Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these terms in many champion class features. Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Sanctified: If you are holy or unholy, your sanctified actions and spells gain the same trait. Roleplaying the Champion During Combat Encounters... You confront enemies in hand-to-hand combat while carefully positioning yourself to protect your allies. During Social Encounters... You are a voice of devoted authority, with strong intentions to embody the behaviors your deity encourages. While Exploring... You overcome barriers both physical and spiritual, providing inspiration to your allies through your actions and—when your fellow adventurers ask for it—providing guidance with a sure hand. In Downtime... You spend much of your time in solemn prayer and contemplation, rigorous training, and fulfilling the edicts of your cause, but that doesn't mean there isn't time to take up a craft or hobby. You Might... Believe the righteousness of your cause will triumph, no matter how grim the odds. Explain how the teachings of your deity apply to decisions and actions in everyday life. Be a bit overprotective of your allies. Others Probably... See you as a symbol of your deity, and carry over their opinions of that deity to you.

Know that you've sworn divine oaths of service they can trust you to keep. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Deity As a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity you revere above all others. TThe most common deities in Pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity. Skill You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. Anathema Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.

If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists “none,” you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone . Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options. Holy: You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them” and the anathema “Commit murder.” Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you. Unholy: You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, “Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity” and the anathema “Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity” and “Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.” None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity. Deific Weapon You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain access to it, and if it's an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency. Champion's Aura You're surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you're a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion's reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious. Cause You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name. Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction. Causes can be found here. Devotion Spells Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose either shields of the spirit or a spell based on your deity's divine font ( lay on hands if your deity allows heal, touch of the void if your deity allows harm). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes. Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. Champion Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a champion class feat. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Blessing of the Devoted Your deity blesses your service with a boon. This might come in the form of a spirit that visits you and inhabits your items or body, a mysterious divine tattoo upon your body, or the like. Choose one of the following blessings, or any other to which you have access. Blessed Armament: Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows. You gain that armament's critical specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list: fearsome, ghost touch, returning, shifting, or vitalizing. During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both. Blessed Shield: In your hands, a shield gains the minor reinforcing rune. As you go up in level, the shield gains the reinforcing rune of your level (lesser at 7th level, moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at 16th level, and supreme at 19th level). If your shield already has the appropriate reinforcing rune for your level, or if it's a sturdy shield of the same level as the appropriate reinforcing rune, the shield's Hardness instead increases by 1. Blessed Swiftness: You gain a +5-foot status bonus to Speed. If you're mounted, your mount gains the bonus instead. In addition, when the movement of one of your allies triggers an enemy's reaction while the ally is in your champion's aura, the ally gains a +2 status bonus to all defenses against that reaction. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you’re untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you’re already trained to expert.

level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. deity as a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity you revere above all others. tthe most common deities in pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. choose one deity. skill you become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. as normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. anathema champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. as with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the gm, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script. acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces. similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. for example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to pharasma, the goddess of death. many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. for borderline cases, you and your gm determine which acts are anathema. if you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. the class features that you lose are determined by the gm, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. these abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. if your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your gm might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity. sanctification depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. this commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats. if you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Deity</title>\r\nAs a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The most common [deities](Deities.aspx) in Pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Sanctification</title> Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the [holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) or [unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521) trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Anathema</title> Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.\n\n Casting spells with the [unholy](/Traits.aspx?ID=521) trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting [holy](/Traits.aspx?ID=517) spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create [undead](/Traits.aspx?ID=160) would be anathema to [Pharasma](/Deities.aspx?ID=14), the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.\n\n If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Cleric Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the [Cast a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=72) activity. As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the [divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2) spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. \n\nAs you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Divine Font</title>\r\nThrough your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called vitality or its counterforce, the void. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=148) or [_harm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=146) spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your [deity](Deities.aspx); if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of divine intervention.\n\n **Healing Font**: You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only [_heal_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1554) spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.\n\n **Harmful Font**: You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only [_harm_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1552) spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Doctrine</title>\r\nEven among followers of the same deity, approaches vary. At 1st level, you select cloistered cleric or warpriest and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. At 3rd level and every four levels thereafter, you gain another benefit from your doctrine.\n\nDoctrines can be found [here](Doctrines.aspx?ID=).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Cleric Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [cleric class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=26) .\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Resolute Faith</title>\r\nBelief provides a bulwark against insidious thoughts. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYou've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Divine Defense</title>\r\nYour training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou've learned how to inflict greater injuries with your weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Miraculous Spell</title>\r\nYou're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using cleric spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Maker of Miracles](/Feats.aspx?ID=309) feat to gain a second slot. &lt;%END>","name":"Cleric","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/cleric"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/cleric/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/cleric/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/cleric/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/cleric/focus-spells"},{"label":"Doctrines","url":"/classes/cleric/doctrines"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 108","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 108 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe cleric is dedicated to the worship of a single deity and draws divine magic from this devotion.

Blessed with divine magic, you live the ideals of your faith, adorn yourself with the symbols of your church, and train diligently to wield your deity’s favored weapon. Your spells might protect and heal your allies, or they might punish foes and enemies of your faith, as your deity wills. Yours is a life of devotion, spreading the teachings of your faith through both word and deed. Key Attribute: Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following term in many cleric class features. Holy and Unholy: These traits mark something, like your character or a spell, that belongs to one side of the battle between celestials and fiends. Generally, fiends and undead are susceptible to holy abilities and celestials to unholy ones. Sanctified: If you are holy or unholy, your sanctified actions and spells gain the same trait. Spellshape: These actions tweak your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action. Roleplaying the Cleric During Combat Encounters... If you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. If you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies. During Social Encounters... You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell. While Exploring... You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt. In Downtime... You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple. You Might... Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity. Know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma. Cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will. Others Probably... Find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it. Expect you to heal their wounds. Rely on you to interact with other religious figures. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Trained in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in Religion Trained in one skill determined by your choice of deity Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in the favored weapon of your deity.

The number is 4 at 1st level, 5 at 5th level, and 6 at 15th level. † The miraculous spell class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to the boost to Wisdom you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Deity As a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. The most common deities in Pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. Any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way. Sanctification Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. If you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. If you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual. Anathema Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces. Casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. Similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema. If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. Cleric Spellcasting Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in Cleric Spells per Day table above. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips.

A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Divine Font Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called vitality or its counterforce, the void. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of divine intervention. Healing Font : You gain 4 additional spell slots each day at your highest rank of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only heal spells in these slots. At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6.

At 5th level, the number of additional slots increases to 5, and at 15th level, the total number of additional slots increases to 6. Doctrine Even among followers of the same deity, approaches vary. At 1st level, you select cloistered cleric or warpriest and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. At 3rd level and every four levels thereafter, you gain another benefit from your doctrine. Doctrines can be found here. Cleric Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat . Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Resolute Faith Belief provides a bulwark against insidious thoughts. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master.

Divine Defense Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with your weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.

You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using cleric spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Maker of Miracles feat to gain a second slot. &lt;%END>","tradition":["Divine"],"tradition_markdown":"[Divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2)","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=33","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Cleric](/Classes.aspx?ID=33)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 108 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n_Deities work their will upon the world in infinite ways, and you serve as one of their most stalwart mortal servants.

generally, fiends and undead are susceptible to holy abilities and celestials to unholy ones. sanctified: if you are holy or unholy, your sanctified actions and spells gain the same trait. spellshape: these actions tweak your spells. you must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. if you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than cast a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action. roleplaying the cleric during combat encounters... if you’re a warpriest, you balance between casting spells and attacking with weapons— typically the favored weapon of your deity. if you’re a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies. during social encounters... you might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. because you’re wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell. while exploring... you detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. you might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. after a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt. in downtime... you might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple. you might... visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity. know the teachings of your religion’s holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma. cooperate with your allies, provided they don’t ask you to go against divine will. others probably... find your devotion impressive, even if they don’t understand it. expect you to heal their wounds. rely on you to interact with other religious figures.

at 15th level. † the miraculous spell class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots. ancestry and background in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to the boost to wisdom you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. deity as a cleric, you are a mortal servitor of a deity you revere above all others. the most common deities in pathfinder have edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a cleric of that deity. your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. if the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon. your deity also adds spells to your spell list. you can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list once you can prepare spells of their rank as a cleric. any of these spells that aren't normally on the divine list are still divine spells if you prepare them this way. sanctification depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. this gives you the holy or unholy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. if you “can be” holy or unholy according to your deity, you make that choice, and if you “must be” holy or unholy you gain the trait automatically. if you gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you complete an atone ritual. anathema acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces. casting spells with the unholy trait is almost always anathema to deities who don't allow unholy sanctification, and casting holy spells is likewise anathema to those who don't allow holy sanctification. similarly, casting spells that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. for example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to pharasma, the goddess of death. many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. for borderline cases, you and your gm determine which acts are anathema. if you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. the class features that you lose are determined by the gm, but they likely include your divine font and all cleric spellcasting. these abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. cleric spellcasting your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. you are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the cast a spell activity. as a cleric, your chants generally invoke your deity and their powerful servants by name or title, while your gestures are followed by sacred symbols or other representations of your deity at 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells to which you gain access and learn via learn a spell. prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. the number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. as you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in cleric spells per day table above. some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or for your enemies to roll against your spell dc (typically by attempting a saving throw). since your key attribute is wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell dc use your wisdom modifier. heightening spells when you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. this increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. a cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of cleric spell slot you have. for example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. divine font through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called vitality or its counterforce, the

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druid Spellcasting</title>\r\nThe power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the [Cast a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=72) activity (see [Casting Spells](/Rules.aspx?ID=280)). As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the [primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4) spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Anathema</title>\r\nAs stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an [_atone_](/Rituals.aspx?ID=2) ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids.\n\n **Anathema** despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the [Wildsong](/Languages.aspx?ID=116) to non-druids.\n\n Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Druidic Order</title>\r\nUpon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders.\n\n Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=276).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Shield Block</title>\r\nYou gain the [Shield Block](/Feats.aspx?ID=839) general feat , a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Voice of Nature</title>\r\nYou gain your choice of the [Animal Empathy](/Feats.aspx?ID=4709) or [Plant Empathy](/Feats.aspx?ID=4711) druid feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Wildsong</title>\r\nYou know the [Wildsong](/Languages.aspx?ID=116), a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Druid Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [druid class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=52).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Fortitude Expertise</title>\r\nAdventures have made your physique more hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYou've honed your ability to dodge dangers. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Wild Willpower</title>\r\nYour primal will, like that of the greatest beast, can't be tamed. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Medium Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou inflict great injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nPrimal magic answers your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have developed an unparalleled rapport with the magic of nature. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Primal Hierophant</title>\r\nYou command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Hierophant's Power](/Feats.aspx?ID=353) feat to gain a second slot.","name":"Druid","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/druid"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/druid/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/druid/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/druid/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/druid/focus-spells"},{"label":"Druidic Orders","url":"/classes/druid/druidic-orders"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 122","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 122 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe druid walks the wild, primordial places of the world without fear, harnessing the primal magic of nature and controlling it with calm purpose.

It can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. It can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it— and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. You are one of those who hear nature’s call. You stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service. Key Attribute: Wisdom At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Wisdom. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key term in many druid class features. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Druid During Combat Encounters... You call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. You cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. Depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast. During Social Encounters... You represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. You often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can’t have all that they desire. While Exploring... Your nature skills are invaluable. You track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. You might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group. In Downtime... You might craft magic items or potions. Alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. You might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance. You Might... Have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature. Be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it. Treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals. Others Probably... View you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it. Assume you’re a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild. Consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Druid Spellcasting The power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank. Anathema As stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. If you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an atone ritual. The following acts are anathema to all druids. Anathema despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids. Your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry Druidic Order Upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. While you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and PC druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders. Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat , a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Voice of Nature You gain your choice of the Animal Empathy or Plant Empathy druid feat. Wildsong You know the Wildsong, a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. The Wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. Teaching the Wildsong to non-druids is anathema. Druid Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Fortitude Expertise Adventures have made your physique more hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. Reflex Expertise You've honed your ability to dodge dangers. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Weapon Expertise You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. Wild Willpower Your primal will, like that of the greatest beast, can't be tamed.

You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting.

source player core pg. 122 2.0 the power of nature is impossible to resist. it can bring ruin to the stoutest fortress in minutes, reducing even the mightiest works to rubble, burning them to ash, burying them beneath an avalanche of snow, or drowning them beneath the waves. it can provide endless bounty and breathtaking splendor to those who respect it— and an agonizing death to those who take it too lightly. you are one of those who hear nature’s call. you stand in awe of the majesty of its power and give yourself over to its service. key attribute: wisdom at 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to wisdom. hit points: 8 plus your constitution modifier you increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms you'll see the following key term in many druid class features. spellshape: actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. these actions usually come from spellshape feats. you must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. if you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than cast a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. roleplaying the druid during combat encounters... you call upon the forces of nature to defeat your enemies and protect your allies. you cast spells that draw upon primal magic to protect yourself and your friends, heal their wounds, or summon deadly animals to fight at your side. depending on your bond to nature, you might call upon powerful elemental magic or change shape into a terrifying beast. during social encounters... you represent balance and a reasoned approach to problems, looking for solutions that not only are best for the natural world, but also allow the creatures within it to live in harmony and peace. you often propose compromises that allow both sides to gain what they truly need, even if they can’t have all that they desire. while exploring... your nature skills are invaluable. you track down enemies, navigate the wilderness, and use spells to detect magical auras around you. you might even ask wild animals to lend their extraordinary senses and scouting abilities to your group. in downtime... you might craft magic items or potions. alternatively, your tie to nature might lead you to tend a wilderness area, befriending beasts and healing the wounds caused by civilization. you might even teach sustainable farming and animal husbandry techniques that allow others to subsist off the land without harming the natural balance. you might... have a deep and meaningful respect for the power of nature. be in constant awe of the natural world, eager to share it with others but wary of their influence upon it. treat plants and animals as allies, working with them to reach your goals. others probably... view you as a representative of nature, and are sure you can control it. assume you’re a recluse who avoids society and cities and prefers to live in the wild. consider you a mystic, similar to a priest, but answering only to the forces of nature. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. you are untrained in anything not listed unless you

to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. druid spellcasting the power of the wild world flows through you. you are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the cast a spell activity (see casting spells). as a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic. at 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via learn a spell. prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. the number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. as you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the druid spells per day table. some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell dc (typically by attempting a saving throw). since your key attribute is wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell dc use your wisdom modifier. heightening spells when you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. this increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. a cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. for example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank. anathema as stewards of the natural order, druids find affronts to nature anathema. if you repeatedly perform these acts, you lose your magical abilities from the druid class, including your druid spellcasting and the benefits of your order. these abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance with an atone ritual. the following acts are anathema to all druids. anathema despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the wildsong to non-druids. your choice of druidic order adds further anathema, as detailed in the order's entry druidic order upon becoming a druid, you align yourself with a druidic order, which grants you a class feat, an order spell (see below), and an additional trained skill tied to your order. while you'll always be a member of your initial order, it's not unheard of for a druid to request to study with other orders in search of greater understanding of the natural world, and pc druids are among the most likely to blend the powers of different orders. order spells are a type of focus spell. it costs 1 focus point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 focus point. you refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order. focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. certain feats give you more focus spells. the maximum focus points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points. the full rules for focus spells appear here. shield block you gain the shield block general feat , a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. voice of nature you gain your choice of the animal empathy or plant empathy druid feat. wildsong you know the wildsong, a secret language known only within druid orders, in addition to any languages you know through your ancestry. the wildsong is a melodic and tonal language sounding more like animal calls than a spoken tongue, and its alphabet involves fractals and spirals, like the arrangement of a seashell's chambers, a snowflake's crystals, or a fern's fronds. teaching the wildsong to non-druids is anathema. druid feats at 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a druid class feat. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. perception expertise you remain alert to threats around you. your proficiency rank for perception increases to expert. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. fortitude expertise adventures have made your physique more hardy. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to expert. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. the list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. reflex expertise you've honed your ability to dodge dangers. your proficiency rank for reflex saves increases to expert. expert spellcaster your command of primal forces has deepened, empowering your spells. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to expert. weapon expertise you've improved your combat skill. your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert. wild willpower your primal will, like that of the greatest beast, can't be tamed. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to master. when you roll a success at a will save, you get a critical success instead. medium armor expertise you've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. weapon specialization you inflict great injuries with the weapons you know best. you deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. this damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary. master spellcaster primal magic answers your command. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to master. legendary spellcaster you have developed an unparalleled rapport with the magic of nature. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to legendary. primal hierophant you command the most potent forces of primal magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using druid spellcasting. unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the hierophant's power feat to gain a second slot."},{"attribute":["Strength","Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in martial weapons","Trained in unarmed

the Exemplar class._\r\n\r\n_As the war god died, his power rained through the many planes of creation, sparking conflict and instilling divine energy in those previously without it. Whether you were directly touched by this power, claimed it from an ancient being or artifact, or whether it awoke something long dormant in your lineage, a spark of the divine now blazes within your soul, granting you abilities, sacred weapons, and divine signifiers that reach into the realm previously reserved for gods and legends. How you wield these tools and grow your power is for you to decide—you may become a hero or you may turn to selfish ends, but one thing is certain: you intend to carve your epithet in history, immortalized in the memory of gods and mortals alike._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Nahoa.webp\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nThe following new key terms appear in many exemplar class features and feats.\n\n **[Flourish](/Traits.aspx?ID=606)**: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.\n\n **[Ikon](/Traits.aspx?ID=840)**: An item with the ikon trait is a special item provided or created by your divinity that is so tied to you it can serve as a sacred vessel for your exemplar might. You gain three ikons at 1st level from the list on page 43. Each ikon has a passive immanence ability and an activated transcendence ability. A feat with the ikon trait imbues one of your ikons with further capabilities. Whenever you gain a feat with the ikon trait, choose which of your ikons gains that ability; if you have multiple ikons that meet the feat's usage requirements, you can take the feat multiple times to apply its effects to another one of your ikons. These feats list what ikon they can be imbued into, and any number of them can be imbued into a single ikon.\n\n **Immanence**: At any given time, your divine spark can rest within one of your ikons, empowering it with beyond-mortal abilities. As long as your divine spark is empowering one of your ikons, that ikon gains the [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579) trait and grants you the benefits described in its immanence entry (which is also a divine effect). If your ikon has multiple immanence abilities, you gain all of them whenever the ikon is empowered. If an immanence ability occurs on a critical Strike with a weapon, it replaces any [critical specialization effect](/Rules.aspx?ID=235) that weapon might otherwise have.\n\n **[Transcendence](/Traits.aspx?ID=842)**: Transcendence channels the might of your divine spark through one of your ikons to surpass the mortal and enact a miraculous deed. Each ikon has an action with the transcendence trait, and using it is called Sparking Transcendence. To use the action, your divine spark must be empowering that ikon and you must have the ikon ready to use (typically holding a weapon ikon or wearing a worn ikon). Immediately after you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon, coming to rest in another ikon of your choice. You can Spark Transcendence only once each round. As it comes from your divine spark, a transcendence action has the [divine](/Traits.aspx?ID=579) trait.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Exemplar</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou fight on the vanguard, scattering lesser foes to the winds.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Divine Spark and Ikons</title>\r\nWithin your soul is a tiny spark of divine power that belongs not to a deity, but is something you've claimed all your own. You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power. Select three [ikons](Ikons.aspx).\n\n By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the Shift Immanence action. \n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-3030\" /> \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Spark Transcendence</title> While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Expanding Immanence And Transcendence</title> Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats.

You come to bear an epithet—a word or phrase that seems to always stick in the mind of those describing you. Your epithets grant you additional abilities, especially when your divine spark is brought to the surface.\n\n You first gain a root epithet to describe an aspect of your personality. This grants you a skill, as well as a special effect that occurs when you Spark Transcendence. If you are already trained in the granted skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice, as normal. An effect that occurs after you Spark Transcendence happens immediately after your transcendence action is completely resolved. Choose one [Root Epithet.](Epithets.aspx?Type=Root)\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Dominion Epithet</title>\r\nYour divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects of creation. Choose one [Dominion Epithet](Epithets.aspx?Type=Dominion). Each one grants a critical specialization ability you can use instead of any others you might have access to, and an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence. Some epithets grant additional benefits, such as feats.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Spirit Striking</title>\r\nYour divine power can't be contained, escaping in flits and embers as you wreak violence. You deal 2 additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert.

As the war god died, his power rained through the many planes of creation, sparking conflict and instilling divine energy in those previously without it. Whether you were directly touched by this power, claimed it from an ancient being or artifact, or whether it awoke something long dormant in your lineage, a spark of the divine now blazes within your soul, granting you abilities, sacred weapons, and divine signifiers that reach into the realm previously reserved for gods and legends. How you wield these tools and grow your power is for you to decide—you may become a hero or you may turn to selfish ends, but one thing is certain: you intend to carve your epithet in history, immortalized in the memory of gods and mortals alike. Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms The following new key terms appear in many exemplar class features and feats. Flourish : Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Ikon : An item with the ikon trait is a special item provided or created by your divinity that is so tied to you it can serve as a sacred vessel for your exemplar might. You gain three ikons at 1st level from the list on page 43. Each ikon has a passive immanence ability and an activated transcendence ability. A feat with the ikon trait imbues one of your ikons with further capabilities. Whenever you gain a feat with the ikon trait, choose which of your ikons gains that ability; if you have multiple ikons that meet the feat's usage requirements, you can take the feat multiple times to apply its effects to another one of your ikons. These feats list what ikon they can be imbued into, and any number of them can be imbued into a single ikon. Immanence : At any given time, your divine spark can rest within one of your ikons, empowering it with beyond-mortal abilities. As long as your divine spark is empowering one of your ikons, that ikon gains the divine trait and grants you the benefits described in its immanence entry (which is also a divine effect). If your ikon has multiple immanence abilities, you gain all of them whenever the ikon is empowered. If an immanence ability occurs on a critical Strike with a weapon, it replaces any critical specialization effect that weapon might otherwise have. Transcendence : Transcendence channels the might of your divine spark through one of your ikons to surpass the mortal and enact a miraculous deed. Each ikon has an action with the transcendence trait, and using it is called Sparking Transcendence. To use the action, your divine spark must be empowering that ikon and you must have the ikon ready to use (typically holding a weapon ikon or wearing a worn ikon). Immediately after you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon, coming to rest in another ikon of your choice. You can Spark Transcendence only once each round. As it comes from your divine spark, a transcendence action has the divine trait. Roleplaying the Exemplar During Combat Encounters... You fight on the vanguard, scattering lesser foes to the winds. You concentrate your divine energy into the right weapon or tool for the moment. When an arrow strikes your skin, it stings no more than a flea; when your spear strikes forward, it can pierce gods. During Social Encounters... You naturally cut a larger-than-life figure. You may use your personal magnetism to inspire others, or you might be a lone and brooding figure who seldom speaks. Either way, your actions and words hang in the air with weight. While Exploring... You feel for the flow of fate, knowing that your path will bring you to your next quest. You may take special interest in certain aspects of nature, society, or the cosmos as your divine spark begins to find itself drawn to certain powers. In Downtime... Inactivity rarely suits an exemplar, so you seek out additional deeds or quests to spread your name. You might search for creatures to slay, compete in athletic contests, or quest for lost artifacts. You Might... Chase glory across the land, beyond the sea, and over the horizon. Take other heroes under your wing, that your legend may live on through them. Feel the weight of immense expectations and obligation. Others Probably... Look to you in times of crisis, thinking you can handle any challenge. Think of you as larger than life, more of the figure of a story than a living adventurer. Mistake your heroism and capability for pride and aloofness. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Expert in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in Religion Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 3 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in martial weapons Trained in unarmed attacks Defenses Trained in light armor Trained in medium armor Trained in unarmored defense Class DC Trained in exemplar class DC Class Features You gain these features as Exemplar.

Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class. Divine Spark and Ikons Within your soul is a tiny spark of divine power that belongs not to a deity, but is something you've claimed all your own. You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power. Select three ikons. By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the Shift Immanence action. Spark Transcendence While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar. Expanding Immanence And Transcendence Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait. Exemplar Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain an exemplar class feat. Humble Strikes Even the most unassuming weapons can accomplish great deeds. When you are wielding a simple weapon, increase the damage die size of that weapon by one step. Shield Block You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Root Epithet As your story unfolds, your personality and deeds begin to shape the potential of your divine spark. You come to bear an epithet—a word or phrase that seems to always stick in the mind of those describing you. Your epithets grant you additional abilities, especially when your divine spark is brought to the surface. You first gain a root epithet to describe an aspect of your personality. This grants you a skill, as well as a special effect that occurs when you Spark Transcendence. If you are already trained in the granted skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice, as normal. An effect that occurs after you Spark Transcendence happens immediately after your transcendence action is completely resolved. Choose one Root Epithet. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Weapon Expertise You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to expert. Dominion Epithet Your divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects of creation. Choose one Dominion Epithet. Each one grants a critical specialization ability you can use instead of any others you might have access to, and an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence. Some epithets grant additional benefits, such as feats. Spirit Striking Your divine power can't be contained, escaping in flits and embers as you wreak violence. You deal 2 additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Unassailable Soul A firm knowledge of (or foolish pride in) yourself and your ability girds your mind against doubt and intrusion. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Divine Premonition A sense of the flow of fate allows you to respond to danger with uncanny alacrity. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Godly Expertise Your divine power increases in might. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Divine Weapon Mastery Your skill with weapons is divinely inspired. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master. Greater Unassailable Soul A wall of confidence blunts every arrow seeking to pierce your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure at a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Burnished Armor Expertise Exposure to your divine spark has reinforced your armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. Greater Spirit Striking Your additional damage from spirit striking increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary. Mortality Reforged Inner fire has burned away the frailty of a mortal body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. Sovereignty Epithet The litany of heroic deeds left in your wake has caused your divine spark to blaze bright enough that it now illuminates your legacy. Choose one Sovereignty Epithet, which grants you an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence. Deific Mastery You have achieved full mastery over your divine spark as its power flows through your body and ikons. Your proficiency rank for your exemplar class DC increases to master. Perception Mastery Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail, the better to watch over your wards and keep an eye out for monsters and other threats. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. Burnished Armor Mastery Your armor shines with divine light, flawless and unyielding.

A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.

Start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—immediately after you're presented with a conundrum. Strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes. Get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them trivial. Others Probably... Find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if difficult to fully comprehend.

On the Case As an investigator, you think of your adventures as cases waiting to be solved. You gain one activity and one reaction you can use to investigate cases: Pursue a Lead and Clue In. Devise a Stratagem You can play out a battle in your head, using brains rather than brawn to execute an attack. Methodology Your studies have made you savvy in a broad spectrum of areas, but one particular investigative process drew your intense—even obsessive—interest. Choose a methodology. Methodologies can be found here. Investigator Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an investigator class feat. Strategic Strike When you strike carefully and with forethought, you deal a telling blow. When making a Strike that adds your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, you deal an additional 1d6 precision damage. As your investigator level increases, so too does the deadliness of your strategic strike. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Skill Increases You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Keen Recollection You can recall pertinent facts on topics that aren’t your specialty. Your proficiency bonus to untrained skill checks to Recall Knowledge is equal to your level instead of +0. Skillful Lessons At 3rd level and every odd-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. This feat must be for an Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill, or for the skill you gained from your methodology. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Weapon Expertise You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Vigilant Senses Through your adventures, you’ve developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank in Perception increases to master. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and to 4 if you’re legendary. Fortitude Expertise Your physique has grown hardy in your adventures. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Investigator Expertise You’ve refined your investigative techniques to an exceptional degree. Your circumstance bonus from Pursue a Lead increases to +2. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to expert. Deductive Improvisation You use your skills at deduction to perform whatever task is necessary to solve the case. You can attempt any check that requires you to be trained in a skill, even if you’re untrained in it; you can attempt any check that requires you to have expert proficiency in a skill so long as you’re trained in it; and you can attempt any check that requires you to have master proficiency in a skill as long as you have expert proficiency in it. Dogged Will In your pursuit of truth and knowledge, you won’t be dissuaded. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Incredible Senses You notice things that are almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary. Light Armor Expertise You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Mastery You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master. Greater Weapon Specialization Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you’re an expert, 6 if you’re a master, and 8 if you’re legendary. Savvy Reflexes With an eye for incoming danger, you masterfully keep yourself out of harm’s way. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead. Greater Dogged Will Your willpower becomes truly unbreakable. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Light Armor Mastery Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master. Master Detective As a master detective, you can solve any case and find all the clues available. Your reputation precedes you, and even the most skilled criminals and deceivers fear you. Your proficiency rank for your investigator class DC increases to master. In addition, if you enter a new location that includes another clue toward answering the question at the heart of one of your active investigations, the GM informs you of the existence of the clue and its type: an object, person, spell effect, or the like. When you find the clue, the GM informs you that you've done so. If there is more than one clue in the location, the GM chooses one to inform you about. When you find any of the clues in that location, the GM informs you that you've done so, even if it wasn't the clue they'd chosen or there are other clues you haven't found.","tradition_markdown":"","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=59","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Investigator](/Classes.aspx?ID=59)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 100 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_You seek to uncover the truth, doggedly pursuing leads to reveal the plots of devious villains, discover ancient secrets, or unravel other mysteries.

your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. what can i investigate? the detail you can investigate is typically a single item, creature, or small location (such as a room or corridor), though the gm might allow a different scope for your investigation. physical clues are usually the best starting point, but the gm might allow you to start an investigation from a rumor you learned or a similar clue. for instance, finding a muddy footprint is enough to ask about the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject. the question at the heart of your investigation should be wide-ranging and not answerable through quick observation or a single die roll. “is this footprint made of mud?” is simple for an investigator to answer, but “who left these footprints?” or “what location did this mud come from?” both have enough potential for an investigation. roleplaying the investigator during combat encounters... your keen insights regarding your foes make you more dangerous than your physical strength would suggest. after spending a moment to study your enemies, your perceptiveness allows you to act quickly, striking them where it hurts most. you often assist tougher members of your party, wisely protecting yourself while providing vital aid. during social encounters... few can stand up against your scrutiny. you might not be the most charming, but you see things for what they really are and develop an understanding of a social situation rapidly. every conversation is an investigation, after all, and you never know what you might uncover! while exploring... you look for clues in your environment. you often prove yourself to be a valuable ally by serving as a party scout, analyzing the intricacies of puzzles or mysterious phenomena, and pursuing leads that could reveal beneficial information. in downtime... you study up on subjects new and old, make new allies you can share information with, and pursue hobbies that keep your active mind satisfied. you might make a bit of coin on the side working as a private detective or consulting with the local constabulary. you might... start asking questions—including several that are quite involved—immediately after you're presented with a conundrum. strive to uncover the deeper meanings behind anything you encounter and to identify the social machinations that truly drive events behind the scenes. get so involved in a case that you ignore other matters, deeming them trivial. others probably... find the cascades of information you spout forth extremely helpful, if difficult to fully comprehend. get a bit annoyed that you're such a know-it-all. rely on you to solve mysteries, puzzles, or other challenges requiring intellectual curiosity and reasoning. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. you are untrained in

You can gain an [impulse](/Traits.aspx?ID=502) with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits. \n\n**[Impulse](/Traits.aspx?ID=502)**: The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the [concentrate](/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.\n\n **[Infusion](/Traits.aspx?ID=503)**: Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself.\n\n [**Overflow**](/Traits.aspx?ID=506): Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with [Channel Elements](/Actions.aspx?ID=2124)). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.\n\n **[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=152)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Kinetic Specialists</title>\r\n\r\nKineticists who specialize in a single element are often referred to by a special title. \n<ul><li>**Air**: Aerokineticist</li><li>**Earth**: Geokineticist</li><li>**Fire**: Pyrokineticist</li><li>**Metal**: Metallokineticist</li><li>**Water**: Hydrokineticist</li><li>**Wood**: Phytokineticist</li></ul>\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Special Rules</title>\r\n\r\nSome rules don't come up that often but can be vital to understand when they do.\n\n **Made of an Element**: Some kineticist abilities work on creatures made of an element. A creature made of rock, sand, or dirt is made of earth, but a creature wearing metal armor wouldn't be considered a metal creature. If it's unclear whether a creature is made of an element, the GM decides.\n\n **Overlapping Kinetic Auras**: A creature that's in multiple kinetic auras at the same time is subject to the special effects of all of them. As normal for duplicate effects, a creature can't be affected by multiple copies of the same effect. For instance, if an enemy were in two fire kineticists' auras, and both kineticists had the fire kinetic aura gate junction, the creature would gain only the higher weakness from the two auras.\n\n **Precious Materials**: Elements you create (using Base Kinesis to generate an element, for example) must typically be ordinary materials of negligible value. You can't create precious or valuable materials like [silver](/Equipment.aspx?ID=277), gemstones, or [duskwood](/Equipment.aspx?ID=273) unless otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Kineticist</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nElemental magic surges from you throughout the fight.

You can develop powers you can use in a variety of situations... or you can choose just a few favorite attacks you use repeatedly.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Social Encounters...</title>\r\nThe elements you channel might guide or even influence how you carry yourself in social situations. You might leap to anger like a raging fire stand your ground as solid as a mountain, keep your motives elusive as the wind, go with the flow like water, make cutting remarks sharp as metal, or exhibit the slow patience of the forest.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">While Exploring...</title>\r\nYour innate connection to the elements hones your awareness of the natural world. In an environment full of an element you can channel, you're unparalleled, with the ability to repeatedly manipulate the element around you.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">In Downtime...</title>\r\nYou could commune with the elements or practice your control over your kineticist powers.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Kinetic Gate</title>\r\nAs a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.\n\n When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements—air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.\n\n Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Single Gate</title> Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.\n\n In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more.

Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Kinetic Aura</title>\r\nThrough your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame, stars of raw metal always changing shape, floating snowflakes, or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura.\n\n You have the Channel Elements action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-2124\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Impulses</title>\r\nAn impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the [impulse](/Traits.aspx?ID=502) trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.\n\n Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Impulse Levels</title> Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its [counteract](/Rules.aspx?ID=371) rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.\n\n Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more “Level” entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a “Level (+4)” entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Impulse Attacks And DCs</title> An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an **impulse attack roll** to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The drained condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a [gate attenuator](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2654) to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Elemental Blast</title> The Elemental Blast impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same.

Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a [composite](/Traits.aspx?ID=501) impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have no valid options for the feat—typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses—you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites.</li><li>**Fork the Path**: Your gate reaches to another elemental plane.

You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time— such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements—you can apply any number of them. (Though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.)\n\nSee [here](Elements.aspx) for all gate junctions by element\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Kinetic Durability</title>\r\nThe sustenance of your inner gate counters harm that would come to your body.

When you make your daily preparations, you can replace one of your [impulse](/Traits.aspx?ID=502) feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental trait. You can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats that vary by element. This follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor.

Roaring fire, pure water, fleeting air, steadfast earth, twisting wood, slicing metal. A kinetic gate inextricably tied to your body channels power directly from the elemental planes, causing elements to leap to your hand, whirl around your body, and blast foes at your whim. As your connection to the planes grows, you attain true mastery over your chosen elements. Key Attribute: Constitution At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Constitution. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms The following new key traits appear in many kineticist class features and feats. Composite : A composite impulse combines multiple elements. You can gain an impulse with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits. Impulse : The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait. Infusion : Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself. Overflow : Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with Channel Elements). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. Kinetic Specialists Kineticists who specialize in a single element are often referred to by a special title. Air : Aerokineticist Earth : Geokineticist Fire : Pyrokineticist Metal : Metallokineticist Water : Hydrokineticist Wood : Phytokineticist Special Rules Some rules don't come up that often but can be vital to understand when they do. Made of an Element : Some kineticist abilities work on creatures made of an element. A creature made of rock, sand, or dirt is made of earth, but a creature wearing metal armor wouldn't be considered a metal creature. If it's unclear whether a creature is made of an element, the GM decides. Overlapping Kinetic Auras : A creature that's in multiple kinetic auras at the same time is subject to the special effects of all of them. As normal for duplicate effects, a creature can't be affected by multiple copies of the same effect. For instance, if an enemy were in two fire kineticists' auras, and both kineticists had the fire kinetic aura gate junction, the creature would gain only the higher weakness from the two auras. Precious Materials : Elements you create (using Base Kinesis to generate an element, for example) must typically be ordinary materials of negligible value. You can't create precious or valuable materials like silver, gemstones, or duskwood unless otherwise noted. Roleplaying the Kineticist During Combat Encounters... Elemental magic surges from you throughout the fight. Without any restrictions on how often you can use your abilities, you become a reliable slinger of magic. You can develop powers you can use in a variety of situations... or you can choose just a few favorite attacks you use repeatedly. During Social Encounters... The elements you channel might guide or even influence how you carry yourself in social situations. You might leap to anger like a raging fire stand your ground as solid as a mountain, keep your motives elusive as the wind, go with the flow like water, make cutting remarks sharp as metal, or exhibit the slow patience of the forest. While Exploring... Your innate connection to the elements hones your awareness of the natural world. In an environment full of an element you can channel, you're unparalleled, with the ability to repeatedly manipulate the element around you. In Downtime... You could commune with the elements or practice your control over your kineticist powers. Through retraining, you can realign the flow of your kinetic gate to perfect different manifestations of your element. You Might... Have a conflicted relationship with the kinetic gate that fuels your kineticist magic, possibly because it manifested at a traumatic point in your past. Struggle with controlling and understanding your elemental powers. Form a kinship with elemental creatures or feel at home in areas strong with your element. Others Probably... Find your ability to keep calling on more and more elemental power truly astonishing. Defer to you in all matters related to your element, from the smallest tasks to the politics of the elemental planes. Worry you'll consume yourself with elemental magic or lose control of its primal forces. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You're untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Kinetic Gate As a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level. When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements—air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum. Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements. Single Gate Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait. In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below. Air Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead. Earth Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. Fire Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step. Metal Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage). Water After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against. Wood You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn. Dual Gate Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other. Kinetic Aura Through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. The form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. Examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame, stars of raw metal always changing shape, floating snowflakes, or splinters dancing in the air. If you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura. You have the Channel Elements action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura. Impulses An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements. Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses. Impulse Levels Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level. Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more “Level” entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a “Level (+4)” entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Impulse Attacks And DCs An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an impulse attack roll to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The drained condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a gate attenuator to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier. Elemental Blast The Elemental Blast impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse. Base Kinesis The Base Kinesis impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element. Kineticist Feats At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a kineticist class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Extract Element Creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. You gain the Extract Element action. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Will Expertise Your mental defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Gate's Threshold You reach a new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's power. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path. Expand the Portal : Your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a composite impulse. You also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. If you have no valid options for the feat—typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses—you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites. Fork the Path : Your gate reaches to another elemental plane. Add a new element of your choice to your kinetic elements. Gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. You can't select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection. Gate Junctions When you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic technique. Choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements. A critical blast junction happens when you get a critical success with an Elemental Blast of the kinetic element. An elemental resistance grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. This resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature or effect that has any of the listed traits. At 17th level, you gain immunity to effects with any of the listed traits. This doesn't make you immune to creatures with such a trait. You can voluntarily forgo this resistance, immunity, or both if you want an effect to work on you. You can choose an impulse junction instead of one of the listed junctions. Impulse junctions are listed under Single Gate class feature above. An aura junction adds an effect to your kinetic aura when you Channel Elements. A skill junction makes you trained in the listed skill and grants you the listed skill feat. If you were already trained in the listed skill, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. While your kinetic aura is active, you gain a +1 status bonus to the listed skill; the bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 17th level. You can select each gate junction only once, unless noted otherwise, but you can have the same type of junction for multiple elements. You can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. If you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time— such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements—you can apply any number of them. (Though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.) See here for all gate junctions by element Kinetic Durability The sustenance of your inner gate counters harm that would come to your body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. Kinetic Expertise Your kinetic gate grows stronger, making your elements harder to resist. The power flowing from you is even harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Kinetic Quickness Your body flows with the elegance of a flame, a wave, a breeze. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead. Reflow Elements You twist one of the impulses you've learned into a different but still similar magic. When you make your daily preparations, you can replace one of your impulse feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental trait. You can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats that vary by element. This follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats. Weapon Expertise You've improved your combat skill. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Light Armor Expertise You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Greater Kinetic Durability Your gate protects you even more. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take. Kinetic Mastery The power flowing from you grows even difficult to resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to master. Double Reflow Your kinetic gate becomes even more adaptable. When you use reflow elements, you can replace two impulse feats instead of one. Final Gate Your kinetic gate reaches a perfect form, its power constantly fighting to be released. If your kinetic aura is inactive, you automatically use the first action of your turn to Channel Elements as a free action. You can deliberately suppress the effect. If you're unable to act, final gate still functions, but you don't get to use the Elemental Blast or stance impulse you normally do from using Channel Elements. Kinetic Legend Your elements become almost impossible to resist. Your proficiency rank for your kineticist class DC increases to legendary. Light Armor Mastery Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.","tradition_markdown":"","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=23","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Trained","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Kineticist](/Classes.aspx?ID=23)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Rage of Elements](/Sources.aspx?ID=205) pg. 13 <sup>2.0</sup>\n\n_The power of the elements flows from within you.

increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms the following new key traits appear in many kineticist class features and feats. composite : a composite impulse combines multiple elements. you can gain an impulse with the composite trait only if your kinetic elements include all the elements listed in the impulse's traits. impulse : the primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. you can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. the impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. if an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait. infusion : actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. you must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. if you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself. overflow : powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. when you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with channel elements). extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate. stance : a stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait and that you remain in for some time. a stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. after you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. you can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. kinetic specialists kineticists who specialize in a single element are often referred to by a special title. air : aerokineticist earth : geokineticist fire : pyrokineticist metal : metallokineticist water : hydrokineticist wood : phytokineticist special rules some rules don't come up that often but can be vital to understand when they do. made of an element : some kineticist abilities work on creatures made of an element. a creature made of rock, sand, or dirt is made of earth, but a creature wearing metal armor wouldn't be considered a metal creature. if it's unclear whether a creature is made of an element, the gm decides. overlapping kinetic auras : a creature that's in multiple kinetic auras at the same time is subject to the special effects of all of them. as normal for duplicate effects, a creature can't be affected by multiple copies of the same effect. for instance, if an enemy were in two fire kineticists' auras, and both kineticists had the fire kinetic aura gate junction, the creature would gain only the higher weakness from the two auras. precious materials : elements you create (using base kinesis to generate an element, for example) must typically be ordinary materials of negligible value. you can't create precious or valuable materials like silver, gemstones, or duskwood unless otherwise noted. roleplaying the kineticist during combat encounters... elemental magic surges from you throughout the fight. without any restrictions on how often you can use your abilities, you become a reliable slinger of magic. you can develop powers you can use in a variety of situations... or you can choose just a few favorite attacks you use repeatedly. during social encounters... the elements you channel might guide or even influence how you carry yourself in social situations. you might leap to anger like a raging fire stand your ground as solid as a mountain, keep your motives elusive as the wind, go with the flow like water, make cutting remarks sharp as metal, or exhibit the slow patience of the forest. while exploring... your innate connection to the elements hones your awareness of the natural world. in an environment full of an element you can channel, you're unparalleled, with the ability to repeatedly manipulate the element around you. in downtime... you could commune with the elements or practice your control over your kineticist powers. through retraining, you can realign the flow of your kinetic gate to perfect different manifestations of your element. you might... have a conflicted relationship with the kinetic gate that fuels your kineticist magic, possibly because it manifested at a traumatic point in your past. struggle with controlling and understanding your elemental powers. form a kinship with elemental creatures or feel at home in areas strong with your element. others probably... find your ability to keep calling on more and more elemental power truly astonishing. defer to you in all matters related to your element, from the smallest tasks to the politics of the elemental planes. worry you'll consume yourself with elemental magic or lose control of its primal forces. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. you're untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. perception trained in perception saving throws expert in fortitude expert

your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. kinetic gate as a kineticist, you've awakened or opened a kinetic gate, a supernatural conduit within your body that can channel elemental forces straight from the elemental planes. you can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level. when selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements—air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. for example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum. your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. you can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under impulses. at higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements. single gate your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait. in addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. this happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. you can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below. air before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either stride up to half your speed or step. if you have a fly speed, you can fly up to half your fly speed instead. earth fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to ac until the start of your next turn. fire increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step. metal choose acid, electricity, or piercing. until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage). water after the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. this can't move the creature into the air. you can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against. wood you gain temporary hit points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn. dual gate your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. select two elements to be your kinetic elements. then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other. kinetic aura through your kinetic gate, elements flow from an elemental plane to orbit your person. the form and appearance of this kinetic aura are unique to you. examples include a chaotic wind orbiting the body, fragments of floating gravel, colorful wicks of flame, stars of raw metal always changing shape, floating snowflakes, or splinters dancing in the air. if you can channel more than one element, pieces of all your kinetic elements appear in the aura. you have the channel elements action, which lets you activate your kinetic aura. impulses an impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. to wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. you automatically gain the elemental blast and base kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. you can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. you can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements. impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses. impulse levels any impulse you use is the same level you are. for instance, if you're 5th level, your elemental blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level. similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. in these cases, the impulse ends with one or more “level” entries. this either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. for instance, a 1st-level impulse with a “level (+4)” entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. impulse attacks and dcs an impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class dc. some of your impulses require you to attempt an impulse attack roll to see how effective they are. your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class dc. like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. this means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class dc. the drained condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class dcs. you can acquire a gate attenuator to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier. elemental blast the elemental blast impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. you can customize the appearance of your elemental blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse. base kinesis the base kinesis impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element. kineticist feats at 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a kineticist class feat. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. extract element creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. you gain the extract element action. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. will expertise your mental defenses grow stronger. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to expert. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. gate's threshold you reach a new milestone in your odyssey to become in tune with your kinetic gate and must decide how to expand the gate's power. at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose to either expand the portal or fork the path. expand the portal : your gate attunes more precisely to one of your elements. gain an impulse feat of your level or lower for one of your kinetic elements; if you have more than one element, you can choose a composite impulse. you also gain a gate junction for one of your kinetic elements. if you have no valid options for the feat—typically because you have one kinetic element and devoted your class feats to gaining that element's impulses—you can instead select any kineticist class feat of your level or lower for which you meet the prerequisites. fork the path : your gate reaches to another elemental plane. add a new element of your choice to your kinetic elements. gain an impulse feat of your level or lower with the trait of that element. you can't select a composite impulse feat with this feat selection. gate junctions when you gain a gate junction, you develop a specialized kinetic technique. choose one benefit from the gate junction table for one of your kinetic elements. a critical blast junction happens when you get a critical success with an elemental blast of the kinetic element. an elemental resistance grants you resistance to damage while your kinetic aura is active. this resistance is equal to your level, and it applies to damage of any listed type or that comes from a creature or effect that has any of the listed traits. at 17th level, you gain immunity to effects with any of the listed traits. this doesn't make you immune to creatures with such a trait. you can voluntarily forgo this resistance, immunity, or both if you want an effect to work on you. you can choose an impulse junction instead of one of the listed junctions. impulse junctions are listed under single gate class feature above. an aura junction adds an effect to your kinetic aura when you channel elements. a skill junction makes you trained in the listed skill and grants you the listed skill feat. if you were already trained in the listed skill, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. while your kinetic aura is active, you gain a +1 status bonus to the listed skill; the bonus increases to +2 at 10th level and +3 at 17th level. you can select each gate junction only once, unless noted otherwise, but you can have the same type of junction for multiple elements. you can always choose not to use a gate junction when it would normally occur. if you have multiple junctions that would apply at the same time— such as kinetic aura junctions for different elements—you can apply any number of them. (though note that you can use only one impulse junction per round.) see here for all gate junctions by element kinetic durability the sustenance of your inner gate counters harm that would come to your body. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to master. when you roll a success on a fortitude save, you get a critical success instead. kinetic expertise your kinetic gate grows stronger, making your elements harder to resist. the power flowing from you is even harder to resist. your proficiency rank for your kineticist class dc increases to expert. perception expertise you remain alert to threats around you. your proficiency rank for perception increases to expert. kinetic quickness your body flows with the elegance of a flame, a wave, a breeze. your proficiency rank for reflex saves increases to master. when you roll a success on a reflex save, you get a critical success instead. reflow elements you twist one of the impulses you've learned into a different but still similar magic. when you make your daily preparations, you can replace one of your impulse feats with a different impulse feat that has the same elemental trait. you can reflow only impulse feats that have exactly one elemental trait, not composite impulse feats or feats that vary by element. this follows the same rules as retraining; you can replace impulse feats gained through your class feats or through class features that grant you impulse feats. weapon expertise you've improved your combat skill. your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. light armor expertise you've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert. weapon specialization you've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. you deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. this damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. greater kinetic durability your gate protects you even more. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to legendary. when you roll a critical failure on a fortitude save, you get a failure instead. when you fail a fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take. kinetic mastery the power flowing from you grows even difficult to resist. your proficiency rank for your kineticist class dc increases to master. double reflow your kinetic gate becomes even more adaptable. when you use reflow elements, you can replace two impulse feats instead of one. final gate your kinetic gate reaches a perfect form, its power constantly fighting to be released. if your kinetic aura is inactive, you automatically use the first action of your turn to channel elements as a free action. you can deliberately suppress the effect. if you're unable to act, final gate still functions, but you don't get to use the elemental blast or stance impulse you normally do from using channel elements. kinetic legend your elements become almost impossible to resist. your proficiency rank for your kineticist class dc increases to legendary. light armor mastery your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master."},{"attribute":["Strength","Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Untrained in all armor","Expert in unarmored defense"],"exclude_from_search":false,"fortitude_proficiency":"Expert","hp":10,"hp_raw":"10","icon_image":"/Images/Class/Monk_Icon.png","id":"class-60","image":["/Images/Classes/Iconic_Sajan.png"],"legacy_id":["class-8"],"markdown":"<title level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Monk](/Classes.aspx?ID=60)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 114 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_The strength of your fist flows from your mind and spirit.

You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn.\n\n**[Incapacitation](/Traits.aspx?ID=631)**: An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step.\n\n**Qi Spells**: By tapping into an inner reserve of energy, called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which are a type of [focus spell](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs; your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. You also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to steady your mind and breath to draw in more qi from the world around you. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.\n\n **[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=701)**: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can [Dismiss](/Actions.aspx?ID=2311) a stance.\n\n **[Venomous](/Traits.aspx?ID=785)**: These weapons inject poison into every hit. When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an additional 1 [persistent poison damage](/Conditions.aspx?ID=29). This increases to 2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a _greater striking rune_.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Monk</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers.

You seek perfection, honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into an orderly bastion of wisdom. You're a fierce combatant renowned for martial arts skills and combat stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment. Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many monk abilities. Flourish : Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Incapacitation : An ability with this trait can take a character out of the fight. But when you use an incapacitation effect against a creature of higher level than you, you reduce the degree of success of your attack roll by one step, and that creature improves the degree of success of its saving throws for that effect by one step. Qi Spells : By tapping into an inner reserve of energy, called qi, you can cast special spells called qi spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first qi spell, you decide whether your qi spells are divine or occult spells, and you become trained in spell attack modifiers and spell DCs; your key spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. You also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to steady your mind and breath to draw in more qi from the world around you. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. Stance : A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. Venomous : These weapons inject poison into every hit. When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an additional 1 persistent poison damage. This increases to 2 persistent poison damage if the weapon has a greater striking rune . Roleplaying the Monk During Combat Encounters... You speed into the fray, dodging or leaping past obstacles with acrobatic maneuvers. You strike opponents in a rapid flurry of attacks, using your bare fists or wielding specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let you change up your combat style for different situations, and qi abilities allow you to perform mystic feats like healing yourself and soaring through the air. During Social Encounters... Your perceptiveness lets you see through falsehoods, and your philosophical training provides insight into any situation. While Exploring... You climb up walls, dodge traps, overcome obstacles, and leap over pits. You usually stay toward the outside of the group to protect more vulnerable members, and you're well suited to looking for danger or moving stealthily. In Downtime... You diligently exercise, eat healthy foods, meditate, and study various philosophies. You might also take up a craft that you strive to perfect. You Might... Maintain a regimen of physical training and meditation. Face adversity with a calm and measured approach, never panicking or succumbing to despair. Look to the future for ways you can improve, while remaining at peace with your present self. Others Probably... Marvel at your feats of physical prowess. Think you're more than a bit uptight, given your vows and tenets. Come to you for philosophical advice.

servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely. You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Charisma** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Korakai.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many oracle class features.\n\n **[Cursebound](/Traits.aspx?ID=800)**: Abilities with this trait tighten your oracular curse's grasp on your soul in exchange for divine insights, giving you the cursebound condition (see below). When you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, or if you were already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1. As cursebound abilities are directly linked to your oracular curse, you can't use a cursebound ability if you don't have an oracular curse or if you are already at your maximum cursebound value. You can't mitigate or bypass the drawbacks of any cursebound ability with spells or other effects, and the effects of any cursebound ability end when you Refocus and remove the cursebound condition.\n\n **[Fortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=612) and [Misfortune](/Traits.aspx?ID=654):** Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.\n\n **[Spellshape](/Traits.aspx?ID=513):** Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">The Cursebound Condition</title>\r\n\r\nYour oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery's powers. Cursebound is a condition that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular curse imposes unique negative effects depending on your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound condition only by [Refocusing](/Actions.aspx?ID=2621).\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Oracle</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Social Encounters...</title>\r\nYou rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">While Exploring...</title>\r\nYou recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">In Downtime...</title>\r\nYou might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">You Might...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both.</li><li>Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic.</li><li>Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic.</li></ul>\n\n<title level=\"3\">Others Probably...</title>\r\n\n<ul><li>Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers.</li><li>Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods.</li><li>Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts.</li></ul>\n\n<title level=\"2\">Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Oracle Spellcasting</title>\r\nYou have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind.\n\n Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.  \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are [heightened](/Rules.aspx?ID=2225371) to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the divine list or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Oracle Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.\n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title> As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=2447) during downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Mystery</title>\r\nAn oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.\n\n Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power.\n\nThe list of oracle mysteries can be found [here](Mysteries.aspx) \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Revelation Spells</title> The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of [focus spell](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228). It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells.\n\n The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.\n\n  You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional revelation spells through oracle feats. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Oracular Curse</title> As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.\n\n Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.\n\n Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures [concealed](/Conditions.aspx?ID=62) from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as [_sure strike_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1709) (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, [_cleanse affliction_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1467) and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all.\n\n At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Oracle Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nExperience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nThe intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Mysterious Resolve</title>\r\nThe power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it harder for other powers to grip your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nMagical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Divine Access</title>\r\nYour mystery offers you strange access to spells typically reserved for more conventional worshippers. Choose one deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains. Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Major Curse</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to better tolerate the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. The maximum cursebound value you can have increases from cursebound 2 to cursebound 3.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Oracular Senses</title>\r\nYou have always been able to sense a bit more than others. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Light Armor Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Premonition’s Reflexes</title>\r\nA chill runs through your spine as danger strikes, giving you a hair’s more time to dodge or cover yourself. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery.

You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells, but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you draw upon it, which you might uphold as an instrument of the divine or view as punishment from the gods. Key Attribute: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many oracle class features. Cursebound : Abilities with this trait tighten your oracular curse's grasp on your soul in exchange for divine insights, giving you the cursebound condition (see below). When you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, or if you were already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1. As cursebound abilities are directly linked to your oracular curse, you can't use a cursebound ability if you don't have an oracular curse or if you are already at your maximum cursebound value. You can't mitigate or bypass the drawbacks of any cursebound ability with spells or other effects, and the effects of any cursebound ability end when you Refocus and remove the cursebound condition. Fortune and Misfortune: Fortune and misfortune effects can alter how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune and one misfortune effect come into play on a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you must pick which to use. If two misfortune effects apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If both a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. The Cursebound Condition Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery's powers. Cursebound is a condition that affects only creatures with an oracular curse, and cursebound always includes a value. Your specific oracular curse imposes unique negative effects depending on your cursebound value. You can remove the cursebound condition only by Refocusing. Roleplaying the Oracle During Combat Encounters... You draw upon your mystery to empower yourself in combat, balancing miraculous effects with the increasing severity of your curse as conflicting divine demands overtax your physical body. You cast spells to aid your allies and devastate your foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself. During Social Encounters... You rely upon the insights drawn from your mystery. You might leverage your curse to intimidate people or hide its effects to better blend in. While Exploring... You recenter yourself to bring the terrible metaphysical conflicts causing your curse back under control so you can draw upon your mystery's power again later. You remain aware of supernatural forces acting around you, perhaps peeking into the future to gain insights. In Downtime... You might seek to learn more about your mystery and the divine wellsprings that fuel your power. Associating with others interested in the subject of your mystery can make it easier to live with your curse. You could associate with an organized religion or even start your own faithful following devoted to your mystery. You Might... View your oracular powers as a blessing, a curse, or both. Push yourself to the limits of what you can withstand to work great acts of magic. Rely on magical items to provide a pool of safer and more reliable magic. Others Probably... Don't realize your spellcasting draws upon divine power and instead believe you command stranger—and possibly evil—powers. Assume you performed some terrible transgression to become cursed by the gods. Admire your determination and the sacrifices you make to perform wondrous acts. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Oracle Spellcasting You have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind. Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells on the divine list or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Oracle Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Mystery An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity. Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. Your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power. The list of oracle mysteries can be found here Revelation Spells The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. Revelation spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. You learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. This spell is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. You can learn additional revelation spells through oracle feats. Oracular Curse As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul. Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition. Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, cleanse affliction and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all. At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats. Oracle Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Signature Spells Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Expert Spellcaster The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Mysterious Resolve The power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it harder for other powers to grip your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Divine Access Your mystery offers you strange access to spells typically reserved for more conventional worshippers. Choose one deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains. Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank. Major Curse You’ve learned to better tolerate the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. The maximum cursebound value you can have increases from cursebound 2 to cursebound 3. Oracular Senses You have always been able to sense a bit more than others. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise You’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Light Armor Expertise You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency rank for light armor and unarmored defense increases to expert. Premonition’s Reflexes A chill runs through your spine as danger strikes, giving you a hair’s more time to dodge or cover yourself. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4 if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master. Extreme Curse You have mastered a precarious balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, allowing you to tolerate a perilous degree of divine curse. The maximum cursebound value you can have increases from cursebound 3 to cursebound 4. Greater Mysterious Resolve Your time spent in contemplation of the mysteries of creation has given you a powerful mind and soul. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. Legendary Spellcaster You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary. Oracular Clarity You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the Oracular Providence feat to gain a second slot.","tradition":["Divine"],"tradition_markdown":"[Divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2)","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=61","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Oracle](/Classes.aspx?ID=61)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 128 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer and servitude—you instead glean sacred truths and great mysteries embodied in overarching concepts, whether because you perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely.

differently from other spell slots. ancestry and background in addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. oracle spellcasting you have an unfiltered connection to the great powers of the universe and the planes beyond, and you can let this power spill forth in the form of divine magic. you are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the cast a spell activity. as an oracle, when you cast spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind. each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. you must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. the number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. as you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the oracle spells per day table. some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell dc (typically by attempting a saving throw). since your key attribute is charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell dcs use your charisma modifier. heightening spells when you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. this increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. you must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. the signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. a cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot you have. for example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. spell repertoire the collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. at 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank divine spells of your choice and five divine cantrips of your choice. you choose these from the common spells on the divine list or from other divine spells to which you have access. you can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. you add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. each time you get a spell slot (see the oracle spells per day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. at 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-rank spells, and so on. when you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. if a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa. swapping spells in your repertoire as you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. this spell can be a cantrip. you can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. mystery an oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. this power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. this is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity. choose the mystery that empowers your magic. your mystery grants you additional spells, and special focus spells called revelation spells. your mystery also gives you a unique cursebound ability that lets you draw upon the divine, as well as dictating the effects of the oracular curse that falls upon you when you touch too much of this power. the list of oracle mysteries can be found here revelation spells the powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells. revelation spells are a type of focus spell. it costs 1 focus point to cast a focus spell. you refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the refocus activity to search for omens in a way befitting your mystery, like gazing into a fire, throwing bones and seeing how they fall, or meditating to hear the voices of those who came before you. focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. certain feats give you more focus spells. the maximum focus points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. you learn a revelation spell at 1st level and start with a focus pool of 1 focus point. this spell is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. you can learn additional revelation spells through oracle feats. oracular curse as an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. these abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. the more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul. your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. at lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition. your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. you remain cursebound until you refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a focus point. as your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than refocusing. for example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures concealed from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). likewise, cleanse affliction and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all. at 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your mystery, and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats. oracle feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. signature spells experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. for each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. you don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. if you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. if you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell rank or lower). you can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. expert spellcaster the intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to expert. mysterious resolve the power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it harder for other powers to grip your mind. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to master. when you roll a success on a will save, you get a critical success instead. magical fortitude magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to expert. divine access your mystery offers you strange access to spells typically reserved for more conventional worshippers. choose one deity who grants one of your mystery’s granted domains. add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank. major curse you’ve learned to better tolerate the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. the maximum cursebound value you can have increases from cursebound 2 to cursebound 3. oracular senses you have always been able to sense a bit more than others. your proficiency rank for perception increases to expert. weapon expertise you’ve dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. light armor expertise you’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. your proficiency rank for light armor and unarmored defense increases to expert. premonition’s reflexes a chill runs through your spine as danger strikes, giving you a hair’s more time to dodge or cover yourself. your proficiency rank for reflex saves increases to expert. weapon specialization you’ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. you deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. this damage increases to 3 if you’re a master and 4 if you’re legendary. master spellcaster you truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell dcs increase to master. extreme curse you have mastered a precarious balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, allowing you to tolerate a perilous degree of divine curse. the maximum cursebound value you can have increases from cursebound 3 to cursebound 4. greater mysterious resolve your time spent in contemplation of the mysteries of creation has given you a powerful mind and soul. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to legendary. when you roll a success on a will save, you get a critical success instead. when you roll a critical failure on a will save, you get a failure instead. when you fail a will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage. legendary spellcaster you can harness divine power at a level few others can match. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell dcs increase to legendary. oracular clarity you now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. add two common 10th-rank divine spells to your repertoire. you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can’t use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. you can take the oracular providence feat to gain a second slot."},{"attribute":["Strength","Dexterity"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple

protected from wild creatures. Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Harsk.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many ranger class features.\n\n **[Flourish](/Traits.aspx?ID=73)**: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently.

You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the [Ready](/Equipment.aspx?ID=2792) activity.<br /> Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)\n\n**Warden Spells:** Your relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=2621) activity to commune with nature.<br /> Your warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute is Wisdom.<br /> Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells.

Others say nature needs to be protected from the greedy, who wish to tame its beauty and plunder its treasures. You could champion either goal, or both. You might be a scout, tracker, or hunter of fugitives or beasts, haunting the edge of civilization or exploring the wilds. You know how to live off the land and are skilled at spotting and taking down both opportune prey and hated enemies. Key Attribute: Strength or Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many ranger class features. Flourish : Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Press : Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.) Warden Spells: Your relationship with the world around you extends from the physical to the magical. Certain feats grant you warden spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first warden spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with nature. Your warden spells are primal spells. When you first gain a warden spell, you become trained in spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting attribute is Wisdom. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. Roleplaying the Ranger During Combat Encounters... You can single out particular foes to hunt, making you better at defeating them. You target and brutalize your chosen foe with either a bow or melee weapons, while supporting your allies with your skills. During Social Encounters... When you speak, it’s with the voice of practical experience, especially involving wilderness exploration. While Exploring... You guide your allies through the wilderness or follow tracks. You keep an eye out for trouble, constantly alert for danger even when it’s not overt. In Downtime... You craft weapons and train animals in preparation for your next venture. If you prefer to get outside, you might go on hunts or scout nearby areas to better understand your environment. You Might... Respect the raw power of nature and understand how to make the best of its bounty. Enjoy the thrill of the hunt. Scout out ahead of the party, reconnoitering dangers before combat begins. Others Probably... Call upon you to protect them from the wilds or the encroachment of civilization. Expect you to be a quiet or taciturn loner. Think there is something dangerous and wild about you.

Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents’ missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don’t care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills. Key Attribute: Dexterity or other At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Dexterity or an option from rogue's racket. Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms Below are some key terms in many rogue class features. Debilitation: Debilitations apply conditions and other negative effects to a creature. When the creature is affected by a new debilitation, any previous one it was affected by ends. Flourish: Actions with this trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only 1 action with the flourish trait per turn. Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. Roleplaying the Rogue During Combat Encounters... You move about stealthily so you can catch foes unawares. You’re a precision instrument, more useful against a tough boss or distant spellcaster than against rank-and-file soldiers. During Social Encounters... Your skills give you multiple tools to influence your opposition. Pulling cons and ferreting out information are second nature to you. While Exploring... You sneak to get the drop on foes and scout for danger or traps. You’re a great asset, since you can disable traps, solve puzzles, and anticipate dangers. In Downtime... You might pick pockets or trade in illegal goods. You can also become part of a thieves’ guild, or even found one of your own. You Might... Hone your skills through intense practice, both on your own and out in the world. Know where to attain illicit goods. Skirt or break the law because you think it’s meaningless or have your own code. Others Probably... Find you charming or fascinating, even if they think they know better than to trust you. Come to you when they need someone who is willing to take risks or use questionable methods. Suspect you’re motivated primarily by greed.

1d6 precision damage. for a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse. as your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels. surprise attack you spring into combat faster than foes can react. on the first round of combat, if you roll deception or stealth for

>Ancestry and Background</title>\r\nIn addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Attribute Boosts</title>\r\nIn addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers.\n\n At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Bloodline</title>\r\nChoose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. \n\n Bloodlines can be found [here](Bloodlines.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sorcerer Spellcasting</title>\r\nYour bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the [Cast a Spell](/Rules.aspx?ID=2233) activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.\n\n Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Spell Repertoire</title>\r\nThe collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your [bloodline ](Bloodlines.aspx) You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.\n\n You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.\n\n Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa. \n\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"\">Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</title>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by [retraining](/Rules.aspx?ID=2447) during downtime.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Sorcerous Potency</title>\r\nBecause of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Sorcerer Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a [sorcerer class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=148).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Signature Spells</title>\r\nYour innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. \r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nMagical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYour inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nYou’ve improved your combat skill. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Majestic Will</title>\r\nYour mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Bloodline Paragon</title>\r\nYou have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.","name":"Sorcerer","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/sorcerer"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/sorcerer/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/sorcerer/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/sorcerer/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/sorcerer/focus-spells"},{"label":"Bloodlines","url":"/classes/sorcerer/bloodlines"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core 2","primary_source_raw":"Player Core 2 pg. 144","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2024-08-01","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 144 <sup>1.1</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe intense magic the sorcerer commands comes from neither study nor worship—it comes from their blood, the power of their heritage flowing through …\r\n</summary>","skill_mod":{},"skill_proficiency":["Trained in two skills determined by your bloodline","Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier"],"source":["Player Core 2"],"source_raw":["Player Core 2 pg. 144"],"source_category":["Rulebooks"],"source_markdown":"[Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 144 <sup>1.1</sup>","speed":{},"summary":"The intense magic the sorcerer commands comes from neither study nor worship—it comes from their blood, the power of their heritage flowing through …","summary_markdown":"The intense magic the sorcerer commands comes from neither study nor worship—it comes from their blood, the power of their heritage flowing through …","text":" Sorcerer Source Player Core 2 pg. 144 1.1 You didn't choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There's magic in your blood. Perhaps a divine influence blessed one of your ancestors, a forebear communed with an ancient, primordial entity, or a powerful occult ritual performed long ago influenced your lineage. Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction. Key Attribute: Charisma At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Charisma. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities. Blood Magic: Casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit from a blood magic effect you know. You can typically only benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some feats and abilities may change this. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Sorcerer During Combat Encounters...

Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself both as a spellcaster and as an individual. View your lineage with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection. Rely on magic items, such as scrolls and wands, to supplement your limited selection of spells. Others Probably... Marvel at your ability to create magic from thin air and view your abilities with equal parts admiration and mistrust. Consider you less dedicated than studious wizards, devoted clerics, and other disciplined practitioners of magic, since power comes to you naturally. Assume you're as unpredictable as the magic you bring forth, even if your personality proves otherwise. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. Bloodline Choose a bloodline that gives you your spellcasting talent. This choice determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose them from, the additional spells you learn, and your additional trained skills. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells based on your bloodline. Bloodlines can be found here. Sorcerer Spellcasting Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell. Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Spell Repertoire The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your bloodline You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your bloodline, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see the Sorcerer Spells per Day table), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. When you gain a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the sorcerous gift spell for that rank that's listed in your bloodline, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your bloodline and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot or vice versa. Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime. Sorcerous Potency Because of the magical power inherent in your blood, your spells that hurt or cure are stronger than those of other spellcasters. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage or healing equal to the spell's rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Sorcerer Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a sorcerer class feat. Signature Spells Your innate power allows you to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don’t need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you’ve learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body’s resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Your inherent magic responds easily and powerfully to your command. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Reflex Expertise Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise You’ve improved your combat skill. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You’ve learned to inflict grave wounds with your most practiced weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you’re a master, and 4 if you’re legendary. Master Spellcaster You have achieved mastery over the magic in your blood. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to master. Majestic Will Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Bloodline Paragon You have perfected the magic in your bloodline. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using sorcerer spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don’t gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can’t be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Bloodline Perfection sorcerer feat to gain a second slot. Legendary Spellcaster You demonstrate prodigious talent for spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifiers and spell DCs increase to legendary.","tradition":["Arcane","Divine","Occult","Primal"],"tradition_markdown":"[Arcane](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1), [Divine](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=2), [Occult](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=3), [Primal](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=4)","trait_markdown":"","type":"Class","url":"/Classes.aspx?ID=62","weakness":{},"will_proficiency":"Expert","description":"itle level=\"1\" right=\"Class\" pfs=\"Standard\">[Sorcerer](/Classes.aspx?ID=62)</title>\r\n\r\n<row gap=\"medium\">\r\n<column gap=\"medium\" flex=\"1 1 400px\">\r\n\r\n<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n**Source** [Player Core 2](/Sources.aspx?ID=227) pg. 144 <sup>1.1</sup>\n\n_You didn't choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one.

increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms you'll see the following key terms in many sorcerer abilities. blood magic: casting a sorcerous gift spell granted by your bloodline or a bloodline spell allows you to benefit from a blood magic effect you know. you can typically only benefit from one blood magic effect at a time, though some feats and abilities may change this. spellshape: actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. these actions usually come from spellshape feats. you must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. if you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than cast a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. roleplaying the sorcerer during combat encounters... you use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements. you might be too vulnerable to leap directly into melee combat, or your bloodline might give you abilities that help you hold your own in a brawl. while your magic is strong, you also rely on cantrips in order to conserve your more powerful spells for the right moment (or after you've used such spells up). during social encounters... your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people. while exploring... you detect the magic around you, finding treasures and warning your party of magical traps. when your group encounters mysteries or problems related to your bloodline, you try to solve them. in downtime... you craft magic items or scribe scrolls. your bloodline might drive you to research your ancestry or associate with affiliated people or creatures. you might... have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your magical heritage, you long to distinguish yourself

If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn.

You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.\n\n **[Flourish](/Traits.aspx?ID=606):** Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round.\n\n **[Stance](/Traits.aspx?ID=701):** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance.\r\n</aside>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"2\">Roleplaying the Swashbuckler</title>\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\">During Combat Encounters...</title>\r\nYou show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Initial Proficiencies</title>\r\nAt 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Panache</title>\r\nYou care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. When you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. This heightened state of flair is called panache.\n\n You gain panache by performing actions that have the [bravado](/Traits.aspx?ID=801) trait. [Tumble Through](/Actions.aspx?ID=2370) and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial DC. Normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache.\n\n Powerful finisher actions, including Confident Finisher, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Precise Strike</title>\r\nWhen you make a Strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the Strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.\n\n As your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. At 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a Strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Stylish Combatant</title>\r\nYou gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Swashbuckler’s Style</title>\r\nYour own distinctive style lets you gracefully handle any situation. Choose a swashbuckler’s style. This style determines the additional actions you use to gain panache and makes you trained in the skill related to that action.\n\nA list of all swashbuckler's styles can be found [here](Styles.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Confident Finisher</title>\r\nYou gain an elegant finishing attack you can make when you have panache.

For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace. You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair. Key Attribute: Dexterity At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity. Hit Points: 10 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. Bravado: Actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn. These effects can be applied even if the action had no other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity. Finisher: Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. Finishers can be used only with weapons that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks, for most swashbucklers). You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. Flourish: Actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. You can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. Stance: A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. After you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. You can Dismiss a stance. Roleplaying the Swashbuckler During Combat Encounters... You show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them. During Social Encounters... You are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. You might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking. While Exploring... You keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. You interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection. In Downtime... You might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques and stunts. To maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers. You Might... Portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present. Hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation. Practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty. Others Probably... Admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade. Find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your flamboyant style. Underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade.

Panache You care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place.

harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair. key attribute: dexterity at 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to dexterity. hit points: 10 plus your constitution modifier you increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms you'll see these terms in many swashbuckler abilities. bravado: actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. if you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn. these effects can be applied even if the action had no other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity. finisher: finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. finishers can be used only with weapons that deal additional damage with precise strike (agile or finesse melee weapons or unarmed attacks, for most swashbucklers). you can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. if your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. for example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance. flourish: actions with the flourish trait are special techniques that require too much exertion for you to perform frequently. you can use only one action with the flourish trait per round. stance: a stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and you remain in for some time. a stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you use a stance action again, whichever comes first. after you take an action with the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. you can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode. you can dismiss a stance. roleplaying the swashbuckler during combat encounters... you show off to gain panache, leveraging your flair to build up to powerful finishing moves. you stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. depending on your swashbuckler's style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or beguile, distract, or frighten them. during social encounters... you are equally likely to charm or intimidate others—or both. you might be an adept socialite, or you might create distractions for others who do the talking. while exploring... you keep a careful eye on your surroundings and other people, always prepared to leap into action with bravado and flair. you interact with the environment in bold, sweeping strokes rather than skulking to avoid detection. in downtime... you might carouse at the tavern, repair and maintain your armaments, or train to learn new techniques and stunts. to maintain your impressive reputation, you might build an organization in your name or establish a following of admirers. you might... portray yourself as a heroic daredevil or a roguish braggart, knowing you can live up to the image you present. hold yourself in high esteem, confident in your abilities and your reputation. practice your skills and maneuvers regularly to ensure you never grow rusty. others probably... admire your theatrics, bravado, and skill with a blade. find you arrogant unless they know you well enough to appreciate your flamboyant style. underestimate how much of a threat you pose until they face the end of your deadly blade. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. you are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. perception expert in perception saving throws trained in fortitude

initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class. panache you care as much about the way you accomplish something as whether you actually accomplish it in the first place. when you perform an action with particular style, you can leverage this moment of verve to perform spectacular, deadly maneuvers. this heightened state of flair is called panache. you gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. tumble through and additional actions determined by your swashbuckler's style (see below) gain the bravado trait when you use them. the gm might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. these checks typically involve at least a single action and a non-trivial dc. normally, you gain and use panache only in combat encounters; when an encounter ends, you lose panache. powerful finisher actions, including confident finisher, can be used only while you have panache and cause you to lose your panache. precise strike when you make a strike with an agile or finesse melee weapon or agile or finesse unarmed attack, you deal 2 additional precision damage. if the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead. as your swashbuckler level increases, so does your additional damage for precise strike. at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, increase the amount of additional damage on a strike by 1 and the additional damage on a finisher by 1d6. stylish combatant you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. while you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to

have panache. you gain the confident finisher action. swashbuckler feats at 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a swashbuckler class feat. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels

increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. stylish tricks at 3rd level, 7th level, and 15th level, you gain an additional skill increase you can apply only to acrobatics or the skill from your swashbuckler’s style. you also gain an additional skill feat at these levels. this feat must be for acrobatics or the trained skill from your swashbuckler’s style. vivacious speed when you’ve made an impression, you move even

7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. when you don’t have panache, you still get half this status bonus to your speed, rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment. ancestry feat in addition to the

as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan._\r\n\r\n**Key Attribute: Intelligence** <br />\r\nAt 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence.\r\n\r\n**Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier** <br />\r\nYou increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.\r\n\r\n</column>\r\n\r\n<column gap=\"medium\">\r\n<image src=\"/images/Classes/Iconic_Feiya.png\" />\r\n</column>\r\n</row>\r\n\r\n<aside>\r\n<title level=\"2\" noclass=\"true\" icon=\"\">Key Terms</title>\r\n\r\nYou'll see these key terms in many witch class features.\n\n**[Hex](/Traits.aspx?ID=624):** A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention.

These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action.

This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words.\n\n Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends.\n\n At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability. The patron themes can be found [here](Patrons.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Witch Spellcasting</title>\r\nUsing your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Heightening Spells</title> When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. \n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Cantrips</title> Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Familiar</title>\r\nYour patron has sent you a [familiar](Familiars.aspx), a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the [familiar rules](/Rules.aspx?ID=2121), though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. Your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.\n\n **Spells**: Your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to.\n\n Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.\n\n **Learning Spells**: Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25) exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.\n\n **Undying**: If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Hex Spells</title>\r\nAs a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost.\n\n Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the [Refocus](/Actions.aspx?ID=71) activity to commune with your familiar.\n\n Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear [here](/Rules.aspx?ID=2228). You learn your choice of the [_patron's puppet_](/Spells.aspx?ID=1882) hex or [_phase familiar_](/Spells.aspx?ID=804) hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.\n\n<title level=\"2\" right=\"\">Hex Cantrips</title>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips.\n\n You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of [patron](Patrons.aspx).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Witch Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [witch class feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=323).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">General Feats</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a [general feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=78).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 3\">Skill Increases</title>\r\nAt 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.\n\n At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Ancestry Feats</title>\r\nIn addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 5\">Magical Fortitude</title>\r\nYour patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 7\">Expert Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 9\">Reflex Expertise</title>\r\nYour reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Perception Expertise</title>\r\nYou remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 11\">Weapon Expertise</title>\r\nThrough sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Defensive Robes</title>\r\nThe flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 13\">Weapon Specialization</title>\r\nYou can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 15\">Master Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 17\">Will of the Pupil</title>\r\nCommunion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Legendary Spellcaster</title>\r\nYou've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 19\">Patron's Gift</title>\r\nYour patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the [Patron's Truth](/Feats.aspx?ID=1591) feat to gain a second slot.","name":"Witch","navigation":[{"label":"Details","url":"/classes/witch"},{"label":"Feats","url":"/classes/witch/feats"},{"label":"Sample Builds","url":"/classes/witch/sample-builds"},{"label":"Class Kit","url":"/classes/witch/class-kit"},{"label":"Focus Spells","url":"/classes/witch/focus-spells"},{"label":"Lessons","url":"/classes/witch/lessons"},{"label":"Patron Themes","url":"/classes/witch/patron-themes"}],"perception_proficiency":"Trained","pfs":"Standard","primary_source":"Player Core","primary_source_raw":"Player Core pg. 178","primary_source_category":"Rulebooks","rarity":"common","rarity_id":1,"reflex_proficiency":"Trained","release_date":"2023-11-15","resistance":{},"search_markdown":"<traits>\r\n\r\n</traits>\r\n\r\n<additional-info>\r\n**Source** [Player Core](/Sources.aspx?ID=216) pg. 178 <sup>2.0</sup>\r\n</additional-info>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<summary>\r\nThe witch is a versatile spellcaster who learns their magic from a familiar, sent to them by a powerful and mysterious patron.

The witch's mastery of …","text":" Witch Source Player Core pg. 178 2.0 You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion to any ideal, but as a vessel or agent for a mysterious, otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, a manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan. Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see these key terms in many witch class features. Hex: A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Witch During Combat Encounters... You cast spells to change the course of battle. You use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items. During Social Encounters... You provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others. While Exploring... You remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. Your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities. In Downtime... You brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. You might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community. You Might... Strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans. Seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides. View your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality. Others Probably... Wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power. Appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries. Take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Patron You weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. Your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you'll further the being's agenda in the world, whatever it may be. This entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. They make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words. Rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends. At 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability. The patron themes can be found here. Witch Spellcasting Using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges. At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Familiar Your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. This familiar follows the familiar rules, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal.

Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. The full rules for focus spells appear here. You learn your choice of the patron's puppet hex or phase familiar hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons. Hex Cantrips Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Witch Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a witch class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry Magical Fortitude Your patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster You've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Reflex Expertise Your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master. Will of the Pupil Communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. Legendary Spellcaster You've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary. Patron's Gift Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic.

Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots.

manifestation of natural energies, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural being—but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to anyone else. through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if these gifts will end up serving your patron's larger plan. key attribute: intelligence at 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to intelligence. hit points: 6 plus your constitution modifier you increase your maximum number of hp by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. key terms you'll see these key terms in many witch class features. hex: a hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call. spellshape: actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. these actions usually come from spellshape feats. you must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. if you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than cast a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. roleplaying the witch during combat encounters... you cast spells to change the course of battle. you use magical hexes to hamper enemies and aid allies, while leveraging more powerful spells to control the battlefield, heal, or harm, aided by your extraordinary familiar, brewed potions, and magical items. during social encounters... you provide knowledge on numerous topics, including a variety of magical matters, and you might call upon your patron's magic to charm or deceive others. while exploring... you remain alert for magical traps and treasures, employing a clever array of spells to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. your familiar might aid you through its own considerable set of exceptional abilities. in downtime... you brew potions, craft other magical items, or hunt for new spells for your familiar to learn. you might try to learn more about your patron, their aims, or your own powers, and you might seek out the company of other witches for collaboration or community. you might... strive to learn more about your patron or familiar, your patron's goals, why they chose to empower you, and how you fit into their plans. seek out new sources of magic, like scrolls and spellbooks, to supplement the spells your patron provides. view your familiar as a steadfast ally, a dear friend, or a necessary nuisance, depending on its personality. others probably... wonder about the nature of your patron and the source of your magic, worrying you'll turn on them or that you unknowingly serve to a foul power. appreciate your ability to aid them with magic, whether you do so by helping them directly or by hampering their adversaries. take care not to offend you, fearful that you'll place a malicious hex on them if you're angered. initial proficiencies at 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the

background in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. attribute boosts in addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. if an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. initial proficiencies at 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. patron you weren't born with the power to cast spells, nor have you spent years dedicated to worship, study, or uncovering mystical secrets. your magic instead has been gifted to you by a potent being, one who knows that by empowering you so, you'll further the being's agenda in the world, whatever it may be. this entity is typically mysterious and distant, revealing little of their identity and motivations. they make their will known to you in abstract signs such as omens, dreams, or similar subtleties rather than words. rather than interacting with you directly, your patron works through a familiar—a mystical creature that teaches you, serves as the conduit for your patron's magic, and maybe even keeps an eye on you to ensure you're furthering your patron's nebulous ends. at 1st level, choose your patron, which determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you the skill for that tradition of magic, your first witch's lesson and a unique familiar ability. the patron themes can be found here. witch spellcasting using your familiar as a conduit, your patron provides you the power to cast spells. you are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the cast a spell activity. as a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges. at 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. the number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. as you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the witch spells per day table. some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell dc (typically by attempting a saving throw). since your key attribute is intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell dc use your intelligence modifier. heightening spells when you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. this increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. a cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. for example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. familiar your patron has sent you a familiar, a mystical creature that teaches you magic and facilitates your spells. this familiar follows the familiar rules, though as it's a direct conduit between you and your patron, it's more powerful than typical familiars. your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities: one of these is a unique ability based on your patron and is always selected, and the other is an additional familiar ability that can be selected daily as normal. your familiar gains another extra ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. spells : your familiar is the source and repository of the spells your patron has bestowed upon you, and you must commune with your familiar to prepare your spells each day using your witch spellcasting. your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. you choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. feats can also grant your familiar additional spells. learning spells : your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. it can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. this can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the learn a spell exploration activity. you and your familiar can use the learn a spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. you can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar. undying : if your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. the new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared. hex spells as a favored agent of your patron, you can invoke their power for a more direct magical intervention. a hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost. hex spells are a type of focus spell. it costs 1 focus point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 focus point. you refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the refocus activity to commune with your familiar. focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. certain feats give you more focus spells. the maximum focus points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points. the full rules for focus spells appear here. you learn your choice of the patron's puppet hex or phase familiar hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. you learn most other hexes from witch lessons. hex cantrips hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost focus points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips. you gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. witch feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a witch class feat. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. the list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry magical fortitude your patron's power boosts your physical resiliency. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to expert. expert spellcaster you've learned to better control the power your patron has granted you. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to expert. reflex expertise your reflexes are lightning fast, helping you avoid danger. your proficiency rank for reflex saves increases to expert. perception expertise you remain alert to threats around you. your proficiency rank for perception increases to expert. weapon expertise through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. defensive robes the flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack. your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. weapon specialization you can inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know. you deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. this damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary. master spellcaster you've achieved mastery over your patron's magic. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to master. will of the pupil communion with your familiar has steeled your mental fortitude. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to master. when you roll a success on a will save, you get a critical success instead. legendary spellcaster you've perfected your command of the magic your patron provides. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to legendary. patron's gift your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the patron's truth feat to gain a second slot."},{"attribute":["Intelligence"],"attack_proficiency":["Trained in simple weapons","Trained in unarmed attacks"],"category":"class","defense_proficiency":["Untrained in all

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the [Cast a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=72) activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.\n\n At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook, as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.\n\n As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.\n\n Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw).

You start with a [spellbook](/Equipment.aspx?ID=53) worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like _The Tome of Silent Shadows_ or something more academic, like _Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory_. \n\n The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the [arcane spell list](/SpellLists.aspx?Tradition=1) or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).\n\n Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via [Learn a Spell](/Actions.aspx?ID=25). When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Thesis</title>\r\nDuring your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “_On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic_.”\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane School</title>\r\nMost wizards acquire their knowledge of spells from a formal educational institution, such as the Arcanamirium or the Magaambya. At 1st level, you choose your [arcane school](ArcaneSchools.aspx), which grants you magical abilities.\n\n You gain additional spells and spell slots from the curriculum taught at the school you attended. Some wizards follow the school of unified magical theory, which attempts to forge a new school by studying independently and drawing information from a multitude of texts and tutors. Though a wizard with this approach lacks the focus of formal training, they have greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" >Arcane Bond</title>\r\nYou place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.\n\n<document level=\"2\" id=\"action-2260\" />\r\n\r\n<title level=\"3\" right=\"Level 2\">Skill Feats</title>\r\nAt 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](/Feats.aspx?Traits=144).

You treat magic like a science, cross-referencing the latest texts on practical spellcraft with ancient tomes to discover and understand arcane magic. Yet magical theory is vast, and there's no way you can study it all. Most wizards learn through formal schooling, with their curriculum informing a specific rubric, although particularly driven researchers sometimes piece together their own theories . Key Attribute: Intelligence At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Intelligence. Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter. Key Terms You'll see the following key term in many wizard abilities. Spellshape: Actions with the spellshape trait tweak the properties of your spells. These actions usually come from spellshape feats. You must use a spellshape action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself. Roleplaying the Wizard During Combat Encounters... You likely try to stay out of the fray, carefully judging when to use your spells. You save your most powerful magic to incapacitate threatening foes and use your cantrips when only weaker foes remain. When enemies pull out tricks like invisibility or flight , you answer with spells like glitterdust or earth bind , leveling the field for your allies. During Social Encounters... You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic. While Exploring... You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome. In Downtime... You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own. You Might... Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works—magic in particular. Look for ways to apply the teachings of your school to any situation, seeing problems through the lens of the spells you've devoted your life to learning. Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people. Others Probably... Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous. Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it’s too late. Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way. Perception Trained in Perception Saving Throws Trained in Fortitude Trained in Reflex Expert in Will Skills Trained in Arcana Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier Attacks Trained in simple weapons Trained in unarmed attacks Defenses Untrained in all armor Trained in unarmored defense Class DC Trained in wizard class DC Spells Trained in spell attack modifier Trained in spell DC Class Features You gain these features as Wizard.

Ancestry and Background In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background. Attribute Boosts In addition to what you get from your class at 1st level, you have four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you get four free boosts to different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1. Initial Proficiencies At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These are noted at the start of this class. Wizard Spellcasting Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life. At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook, as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Heightening Spells When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. Cantrips Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. Spellbook Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like The Tome of Silent Shadows or something more academic, like Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory . The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school). Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory). Arcane Thesis During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “ On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic .” Arcane School Most wizards acquire their knowledge of spells from a formal educational institution, such as the Arcanamirium or the Magaambya. At 1st level, you choose your arcane school, which grants you magical abilities. You gain additional spells and spell slots from the curriculum taught at the school you attended. Some wizards follow the school of unified magical theory, which attempts to forge a new school by studying independently and drawing information from a multitude of texts and tutors. Though a wizard with this approach lacks the focus of formal training, they have greater flexibility. Arcane Bond You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action. Skill Feats At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. Wizard Feats At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat. General Feats At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. Skill Increases At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. Ancestry Feats In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. Reflex Expertise You've developed a knack for dodging danger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert. Expert Spellcaster Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to expert. Magical Fortitude Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert. Perception Expertise You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert. Weapon Expertise Through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Defensive Robes The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. Weapon Specialization You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. Master Spellcaster You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master. Prodigious Will Your mind is simply too complex and sophisticated to be tampered with. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.

level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. these are noted at the start of this class. wizard spellcasting through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. you are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the cast a spell activity. as a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life. at 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook, as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. the number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. as you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the wizard spells per day table. some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell dc (typically by attempting a saving throw). since your key attribute is intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell dc use your intelligence modifier. heightening spells when you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. this increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. cantrips some of your spells are cantrips. a cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. a cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up— this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. for example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells. spellbook every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. you start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. your spellbook's form and name are up to you. it might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like the tome of silent shadows or something more academic, like advanced pyromantic applications of jalmeri elemental theory . the spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. you choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. you also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school). each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via learn a spell. when you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory). arcane thesis during your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research. you gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. the arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like “ on the methods of spell interpolation and the genesis of a new understanding of the building blocks of magic .” arcane school most wizards acquire their knowledge of spells from a formal educational institution, such as the arcanamirium or the magaambya. at 1st level, you choose your arcane school, which grants you magical abilities. you gain additional spells and spell slots from the curriculum taught at the school you attended. some wizards follow the school of unified magical theory, which attempts to forge a new school by studying independently and drawing information from a multitude of texts and tutors. though a wizard with this approach lacks the focus of formal training, they have greater flexibility. arcane bond you place some of your magical power in a bonded item. each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. this is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. you gain the drain bonded item free action. skill feats at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. you must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat. wizard feats at 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat. general feats at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. skill increases at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. you can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. at 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master. ancestry feats in addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. the list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry. reflex expertise you've developed a knack for dodging danger. your proficiency rank for reflex saves increases to expert. expert spellcaster extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to expert. magical fortitude magical power has improved your body's resiliency. your proficiency rank for fortitude saves increases to expert. perception expertise you remain alert to threats around you. your proficiency rank for perception increases to expert. weapon expertise through sheer experience, you've improved your technique with your weapons. your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. defensive robes the flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert. weapon specialization you've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. you deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. this damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary. master spellcaster you command superlative spellcasting ability. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to master. prodigious will your mind is simply too complex and sophisticated to be tampered with. your proficiency rank for will saves increases to master. when you roll a success at a will save, you get a critical success instead. archwizard's spellcraft you command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. you gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using wizard spellcasting. unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the archwizard's might feat to gain a second slot. legendary spellcaster you are a consummate spellcaster, blending both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell dc increase to legendary."}]
